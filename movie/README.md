# Movie subtitles

This directory contains the subtitles for the [Ada & Zangemann
movie](https://fsfe.org/activities/ada-zangemann/movie). As the timing of the
movie is consistent between the spoken languages, the subtitles will work for
all languages too. And because the text is the main text of the book the
translations of the book and subtitles can be shared.

Each subtitle translation should have a file name according the [ISO
639â€‘1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) two-letter code or the [ISO
63902](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2) three-letter code if necessary.
A complementary `.srt.license` file should contain copyright and license
information according to the [REUSE
standard](https://reuse.software/spec-3.3/#comment-headers).

1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:10,120
Ada and Zangemann: a tale of software, skateboards, and raspberry ice cream.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,680
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ada.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,920
Her family was so poor that all their savings fit inside a cookie jar.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,520
They didn't have enough money to live in a proper home.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,700
Instead, Ada lived with her mother and her little brother, Alan, in a cabin near a junkyard

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,040
on the edge of town.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,580
Far away at the other end of town lived a famous inventor named Zangemann.

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,740
He was immensely rich.

9
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,760
No sheet of paper in the world was big enough to show his bank balance with all its numbers

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,180
and zeros.

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,060
He lived in a huge house with a swimming pool and waterslide, lots of staircases and

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:09,960
towers, hundreds of windows, and so many rooms that he often got lost in them himself.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,660
Zangemann's mansion stood high on a hill.

14
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,340
From there, he could look out over the whole city.

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,980
Computers had fascinated Zangemann ever since he was a child.

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,840
When he was young, computers were huge machines.

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,080
with lots of cables and loud noisy fans.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,780
At school, little Zangemann often dreamed of all the things he would do with computers

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,780
if they were just a little bit smaller.

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,060
Small enough that they could be built into other fun things.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,520
He knew what he would do.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,220
First, he would build a computer into his skateboard so that it would make cool noises

23
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,600
when he rode it.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,500
Maybe a fire engine siren or the sound of a rocket launch.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Then he would use a computer to invent ice cream making machines.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,000
The computer would mix the coolest flavors and even sell the ice cream.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,140
There would be machines on every street corner, and he could get ice cream in his favorite

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,200
flavor whenever he felt like it, and just as much as he wanted.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,020
After that, he’d build a cleaning robot and a block sorting machine so that his room would

30
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,760
always be neat and clean.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,160
Zangemann had great new ideas.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,200
like these every day.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,680
He could think of nothing else.

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,200
As the years went by, Zangemann grew bigger and computers got smaller.

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,620
In fact, by the time he finished school, they were so small they fit into his pocket.

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,280
The smallest ones even fit on his fingertip.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,820
“Finally, I can turn all my ideas into real things”,

38
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,200
Zangemann exclaimed.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,940
And he got right to work.

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,700
He found ways to put the small computers into all kinds of things to make them even more

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,920
fun and useful.

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,400
And then he sold them.

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,020
Adults and children loved his inventions.

44
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,060
All the kids wanted to have one of his skateboards, complete with the latest sounds to show off

45
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,220
to their friends at school.

46
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,980
Kids also loved his speaker invention, which could instantly play any song you requested.

47
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:30,080
And of course, everyone loved the ice cream served every afternoon from the automatic,

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,680
extra delicious, original Zangemann ice cream machine.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,220
It all seemed like magic, but the secret was simple.

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,740
The little computers that Zangemann built into his machines made it all possible.

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,100
These inventions were very popular at Ada's school.

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,640
And many of her friends rode around on the cool skateboards.

53
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,780
Ada was often sad, since her mother couldn't buy her any of those great things.

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,380
No skateboard.

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,960
No speakers.

56
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
No ice cream.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,520
Luckily, Ada lived right next to the junkyard.

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,700
There were lots of broken gadgets and rusty parts, which she put together to make cool

59
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,680
new things.

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,460
Like a soapbox she and Alan rode roaring down the hill.

61
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,800
A windmill.

62
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,300
And scary junk monsters, which she and Alan would fight together.

63
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,840
She also found many useful items.

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,680
An old cell phone, for example.

65
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,320
The screen was cracked, but she could fix that.

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,240
And while there wasn’t internet at the junkyard, she could get access somewhere else.

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,400
Ada had so much fun tinkering in the junkyard, and fixing broken things, that she forgot

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,960
all about the skateboards and the ice cream.

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,300
Because everyone bought his inventions,

70
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,260
Zangemann soon became

71
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,260
the richest person in the whole world.

72
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,840
With all his money, he bought a huge golden computer with a keyboard made of jewels and

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,460
set it up in the largest room of his mansion.

74
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,780
From there, over the internet, he could control all the little computers built into his inventions.

75
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,260
All he had to do was press the proper key on the golden computer,

76
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,220
and immediately all the ice cream machines in town would dispense.

77
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
only vanilla ice cream.

78
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:30,220
If Zangemann wanted people to eat chocolate ice cream, he pressed the key for chocolate ice cream.

79
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,220
If he gave the order for lemon ice cream, the machines made only lemon ice cream.

80
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Zangemann loved his inventions and was always thrilled at how amazingly well his machines worked.

81
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Sometimes, people were disappointed when their favorite flavor wasn't available.

82
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
But what could they do?

83
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,220
After all, there was ice cream on every street corner.

84
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Zangemann had a lot of fun pressing the sparkling keys and watching people eat ice cream.

85
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,220
He spent many hours every day in front of his golden computer doing this.

86
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Again and again, he looked down on the city through a long telescope,

87
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,220
observing how reliably his inventions carried out his commands.

88
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:31,220
When he wasn't sitting at his golden computer, Zangemann was building his little computers into new devices and then selling those.

89
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,220
He built washing machines that sent a message to your cell phone when your laundry was done.

90
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,220
He made vacuums that played happy music instead of droning loudly.

91
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,220
He invented light bulbs that turned on and off at the snap of a finger

92
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,220
and cars that told you where the nearest grocery store was.

93
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Soon, almost every appliance in the world had a Zangemann computer built into it.

94
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:02,220
Not all of his inventions seemed necessary at first, but people bought everything he made.

95
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,220
That's just the way it was.

96
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,220
Everyone wanted the devices made by Zangemann, the greatest inventor in the world.

97
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:17,220
One day, Zangemann thought, "Today, I want to see my inventions up close."

98
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:24,220
He put away his big telescope, then climbed down the many stairs of his mansion.

99
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,220
And ventured out into the city, full of anticipation at the thought of enjoying his cool devices.

100
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,220
“Maybe a little trip might even give me a few new ideas.

101
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:42,220
If I'm completely honest, my last inventions weren't quite as useful as the first ones…”, Zangemann pondered.

102
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,220
“But my ice cream machines are and will remain

103
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,220
second to none,” he thought immediately afterward.,

104
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,220
and not without pride, as he passed a group of people all eating coconut ice cream, the flavor of the day.

105
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,220
He was completely absorbed in his thoughts, when suddenly, BAM!

106
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,220
Something crashed into his shin.

107
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,220
Zangemann yelped and looked around for the cause.

108
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,220
A startled child stood in front of him, holding an original Zangemann skateboard under his arm.

109
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,220
"S-sorry, I didn't mean to do that," the child stammered.

110
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
But Zangemann wasn't listening.

111
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,220
An angry Zangemann limped away.

112
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,220
Suddenly, he heard loud music.

113
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,220
He had never before heard something so horrible.

114
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:41,220
He looked around and saw that the music was coming from a loudspeaker he himself had constructed.

115
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,220
A child across the street was holding it.

116
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,220
The child seemed to like the music.

117
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,220
But it gave Zangemann a terrible headache.

118
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,220
And his mood worsened.

119
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,220
This was not how he had imagined his walk.

120
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Zangemann was so furious with the two children.

121
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,220
How dare they use his inventions this way?

122
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,220
That night, he couldn't sleep.

123
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,220
So he sat down at his golden computer.

124
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,220
From there, he gave all the little computers in the skateboards a command

125
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,220
that they were no longer allowed to go on sidewalks.

126
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,220
He ordered the small computers in the speakers to play music only at a low volume,

127
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,220
except for his favorite music,

128
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,220
which he immediately turned on to get into a better mood.

129
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,220
The next day, there was a big commotion at Ada's school.

130
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,220
On the way to school, the kids' skateboards had stopped working.

131
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,220
The wheels simply stood still.

132
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,220
And the children could no longer turn up the volume on their speakers.

133
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
What was going on?

134
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,220
Although she didn't own any of these things,

135
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Ada wondered why the skateboards and the speakers suddenly stopped working.

136
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
But she didn't really have time to think much about it,

137
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,220
because she was tinkering again.

138
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,220
She put together a complete bicycle from the parts of three broken bicycles.

139
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,220
She gave the bicycle to her mother as a present

140
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,220
so that she wouldn't have to spend her money on bus tickets to work.

141
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,220
For her brother, Ada built a loudspeaker

142
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,220
so he could fall asleep to nice stories in the evenings

143
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,220
when their mother was still at work.

144
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,220
After a few days, the initial shock at Ada's school was forgotten.

145
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,220
The skateboards still didn't go on the sidewalk.

146
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,220
But apart from that, they still worked.

147
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,220
And so now the children rode in circles around the playground

148
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
and listened to soft music.

149
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,220
Only a strange, pompous marching music continued to play at an unchanged volume,

150
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,220
which the children found rather puzzling.

151
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,220
Ada loved Wednesdays.

152
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,220
Every Wednesday, her mother and Alan would pick her up from school,

153
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,220
and they would all go to the library together.

154
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,220
Ada was always drawn to the technology section.

155
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,220
There were books with blueprints, instructions for experiments,

156
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,220
and explanations of how different devices worked.

157
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,220
In the library, Ada could also go online with her cell phone.

158
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,220
She quickly realized that there was also much to discover on the Internet.

159
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:37,220
There, many people shared their ideas and prepared tips to help others.

160
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,220
On one of those afternoons, Ada learned two new words:

161
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,220
hardware and software.

162
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Hardware was a word for something Ada already knew:

163
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,220
the electronic devices she tinkered with after school,

164
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,220
or those devices she could hold in her hands and try to fix

165
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,220
or make into something else.

166
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,220
What was completely new to Ada was the word software.

167
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,220
She soon learned that it meant instructions that ran on a computer

168
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,220
to control other devices or computers.

169
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,220
Some books called those instructions "programs" or "code."

170
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,220
With such a computer program, one could, for example,

171
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,220
tell a loudspeaker which song to play and how loud.

172
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,220
The best thing about Ada's new discovery was realizing

173
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,220
she could tinker with software just as she could with hardware.

174
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Hardware is built with tools:

175
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,220
hammers, drills, and screws.

176
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,220
Software is built simply by writing down the commands for the hardware,

177
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,220
one after the other.

178
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,220
There was a separate language for this:

179
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,220
the programming language.

180
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,220
With software, Ada could make her inventions even more useful.

181
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,220
She really wanted to learn the programming language.

182
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Over the next few weeks, Ada spent her afternoons in a library.

183
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,220
She found books and websites that explained how programming languages and code worked.

184
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,220
For Ada, it felt a bit like learning a secret language,

185
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,220
or like studying vocabulary in the school.

186
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,220
Ada ate it all up.

187
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,220
She expected her first program to do something simple:

188
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,220
make this lamp blink.

189
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,220
Of course, she wanted to try her program out right away

190
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,220
to see if it really worked.

191
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,220
At the junkyard, she connected her cell phone to a small LED lamp.

192
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,220
Then she typed the lines of code into her cell phone.

193
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,220
At first, nothing happened.

194
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Ada wondered where the error could be.

195
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,220
She made a few small changes and tried again and...

196
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Yes!

197
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,220
The little light began to flash.

198
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,220
On, off, on, off.

199
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,220
Ada looked at the LED in amazement.

200
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,220
She had written her first program!

201
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Ada was totally thrilled.

202
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,220
She imagined all the great things she could do.

203
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,220
If she just entered the right code,

204
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,220
she could make her inventions do exactly what she wanted.

205
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
It was not so easy.

206
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,220
But after a few weeks, Ada wrote a truly useful program.

207
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,220
One that would make Alan's speakers automatically turn off

208
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,220
half an hour after he had fallen asleep.

209
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,220
Ada also had an idea for the next program she would write.

210
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
It was a bigger deal.

211
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
A real project.

212
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,220
She would probably need the whole summer break for it.

213
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,220
And she could hardly wait.

214
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:06,220
Zangaemann had slept horribly every night since his terrible walk in the city.

215
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,220
When he went to bed each night, worries plagued him.

216
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,220
“Oh, no.

217
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,220
My marvelous inventions.

218
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,220
It can't be that everyone just plays around with them.

219
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,220
All the things that could go wrong.

220
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,220
I put so much thought into everything, down to the last detail.”

221
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
Zangaemann pondered and pondered,

222
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,220
and tossed and turned sleeplessly in his bed all night.

223
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,220
Waking up one morning with a deeply furrowed brow,

224
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
he made a decision.

225
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,220
He needed to make a change.

226
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Zangaemann sat down at his computer

227
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,220
and wrote one program after another.

228
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,220
In these programs, he specified exactly what his inventions were to do

229
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
and were not to do under any circumstances.

230
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,220
The chaos had to stop.

231
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,220
Once he was done,

232
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,220
he sent all the new programs from his golden computer to people's devices.

233
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,220
He ordered his speakers to play only his favorite music

234
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,220
whenever he was within earshot.

235
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,220
He programmed the ice cream machines to stop selling ice cream in the afternoon.

236
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,220
After all, he didn't want his expensive clothes to get stained by ice cream

237
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
while he was out for a walk.

238
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,220
All day long, he sat at the computer

239
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,220
and typed and typed and typed.

240
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,220
Summer break was already halfway over.

241
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,220
Ada stood in front of her big project and scratched her head.

242
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,220
She had built a skateboard from old parts

243
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,220
and then connected a motor to make the wheels turn.

244
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,220
With a motorized skateboard,

245
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,220
after school, Ada could zoom to the library

246
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
or the junkyard even faster.

247
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Super practical.

248
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
But it didn't work.

249
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,220
When she stood on it and pressed the "Go" button,

250
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,220
the wheels moved, but way too fast.

251
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Ada fell off the skateboard every time she started.

252
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,220
No matter what she tried,

253
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
she just couldn't get it right.

254
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,220
After falling on her bottom for the hundredth time,

255
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
she went back to the library.

256
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,220
She always found answers to her questions there.

257
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
And indeed, on the Internet,

258
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
she came across a program

259
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,220
that someone had written for an electric scooter

260
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
that also needed to start slowly.

261
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Ada downloaded it to her phone.

262
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Back at the junkyard,

263
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,220
she adapted some lines of code for her skateboard program.

264
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,220
She tweaked a few things and kept tinkering.

265
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,220
Several failed attempts later,

266
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,220
on the last day of summer break,

267
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,220
the time had finally come.

268
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
Ada stood on the skateboard

269
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,220
and pressed the "Go" button.

270
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
And the skateboard started moving.

271
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,220
Slowly at first, then faster.

272
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,220
It worked!

273
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
She tried to brake. It worked!

274
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
Ada let out a cry of joy

275
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,220
and took a trip to the park.

276
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,220
When Ada rode her skateboard to school

277
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
on the first day back after summer break,

278
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,220
the other children were amazed.

279
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,220
During recess,

280
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Ada's curious classmates surrounded her.

281
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,220
"How can you ride your skateboard

282
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,220
on the sidewalk?" they asked.

283
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,220
Ada thought for a moment, then said,

284
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,220
"I don't think it's your skateboards,

285
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,920
but actually the software in them.

286
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
It's probably programmed into the software

287
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
that the skateboards aren't allowed

288
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,220
to go on the sidewalk.

289
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,020
But that can be changed.”

290
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,920
That evening,  Ada tested out her theory

291
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,120
on her classmate Toni's skateboard.

292
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,920
She worked secretly through most of the night,

293
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,220
and the next day,

294
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Toni could ride on the side walk again.

295
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Unfortunately, his skateboard

296
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,520
could no longer make the sounds

297
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,820
that his parents had bought from Zangermann.

298
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,220
Instead, every ten minutes,

299
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,720
it made a strange noise

300
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,920
that sounded like a drawn-out burp.

301
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,220
Ada knew that little errors like that

302
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,220
could pop up in programs all the time.

303
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
But Toni's burping skateboard

304
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,220
was really quite funny.

305
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
More and more children started to visit Ada

306
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
at the junkyard after school,

307
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
and she helped them rewrite the programs

308
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,220
in their skateboards.

309
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Some of her classmates were very excited

310
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,220
about this new discovery.

311
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,220
It was unbelievable what you could do

312
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,220
with software code.

313
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
They learned everything Ada knew

314
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,220
about programming languages.

315
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,220
And soon they were riding their skateboards again,

316
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
wherever they wanted to.

317
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
But that wasn't all.

318
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
With the software,

319
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
they could give their skateboards

320
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,220
new, cool features.

321
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
Marie attached colorful LED lights

322
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
to her board that glowed different colors

323
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
depending on the speed.

324
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,220
Konrad built old propellers

325
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,220
onto his skateboard for extra speed.

326
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:20,220
Ada, Toni, Marie, and Konrad

327
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,220
spent many afternoons at the junkyard.

328
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,220
They even set up a real workshop

329
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,220
where they can fine-tune their programs for hours,

330
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,220
listening all the while to music

331
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,220
from the speakers Ada had built for Alan.

332
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,220
"Your brother's speakers are much louder than ours,"

333
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
remarked Toni.

334
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,220
It was busy attaching a speedometer

335
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
to his helmet.

336
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,220
"I'm sure that's also because of the software,"

337
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Marie said.

338
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
Together they changed the software

339
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
for the speakers, too.

340
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Then they'd turn up the music

341
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
as loud as possible

342
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,220
and dance wildly together.

343
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Every day, Ada and her friends

344
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,220
made plans together for the afternoon.

345
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
From a broken ice cream machine,

346
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,220
they built a new one that could make ice cream

347
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,220
in every imaginable shape and color.

348
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
They ate square ice cream,

349
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,220
heart-shaped ice cream,

350
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
and even pyramid-shaped ice cream,

351
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
as well as strawberry, raspberry,

352
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,220
and rainbow ice cream,

353
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
all with sprinkles and hot fudge.

354
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Much better than the varieties

355
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,220
from Zangemann's machines.

356
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Sometimes, they could even help adults.

357
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Toni reprogrammed his father's ironing machine

358
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,820
so that it could also iron ties again.

359
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,020
Zangemann had forbidden the machines to do so

360
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,220
because he hated ties like the plague.

361
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,020
For the bus driver,

362
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,720
they built an automatic watering system

363
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,020
out of old hoses and a computer

364
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,220
so that the plants would not die of thirst

365
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
during summer days.

366
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
And they helped the school custodian

367
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
so that it automatically recognized toys

368
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
and wouldn't suck them up.

369
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Some of these machines

370
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,220
could even be used by children.

371
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,220
Some things they built just for fun.

372
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Like the fart machine

373
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
they put in their math teacher's chair.

374
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Whenever Ms. Gernot sat down,

375
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
the machine played a little fart sound.

376
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,220
The teacher would scold them,

377
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
but Ada was sure that she secretly

378
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
smirked a little every time.

379
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,220
One day, Zangemann noticed

380
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,220
that some computers

381
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,220
no longer obeyed his programming commands.

382
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Shocked and fuming with anger,

383
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,220
he called the president.

384
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
In a quivering voice,

385
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Zangemann yelled,

386
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,220
"Someone is rewriting the programs in my devices."

387
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
That can't happen.

388
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,220
After all, they are my inventions.

389
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,220
It's far too dangerous

390
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
if everyone can do whatever they want

391
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
with the computers.

392
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,220
You must make a law against this.

393
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
The president

394
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
did not want to upset Zangemann.

395
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,220
All the government's computers

396
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
were programmed by Zangemann.

397
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,220
Without the computers,

398
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
the government would not be able

399
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
to run the country.

400
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
So they passed a law

401
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
as Zangemann requested.

402
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,220
All computers that do not listen

403
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
to Zangemann are banned.

404
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,220
Anyone who reprograms Zangemann's devices

405
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
will be fined $500,000.

406
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
When Ada and her friends heard this,

407
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
they were furious.

408
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
"This is unfair," they said.

409
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,220
"We rebuilt and reprogrammed

410
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,220
our skateboards ourselves.

411
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
They're much better now.

412
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,220
We won't let anyone take that away from us."

413
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,220
They gathered in front of one of their

414
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,220
rebuilt ice cream machines

415
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,220
and discussed the situation.

416
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,220
It was clear that something had to be done

417
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
about the new machines.

418
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
And they made a plan.

419
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,220
The next day,

420
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
they didn't go to school.

421
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
Instead,

422
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
they rode their skateboards

423
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
to the Parliament building

424
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
with large protest signs

425
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,220
under their arms

426
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
and sat down in front of the building.

427
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,220
The evening before,

428
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,220
they had put LED lights

429
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
on some of the signs,

430
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
which were now flashing brightly.

431
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
They had connected their speakers together

432
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,220
so everyone in the street

433
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
could hear what they were saying.

434
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
So they could hear

435
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
what they were saying.

436
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Some passersby stopped

437
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
and asked the children

438
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
what they were demonstrating for.

439
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
"For software freedom,"

440
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
they replied in unison

441
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
and told the adults their story.

442
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Impressed,

443
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
the adults nodded,

444
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,220
and the President also looked curiously

445
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
at their signs

446
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
as he approached the building.

447
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,220
On the following day,

448
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,220
Ada and her friends again sat down

449
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,220
in front of the Parliament building,

450
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,220
this time with support.

451
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,220
Some classmates came

452
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
whose skateboards

453
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,220
Ada had reprogrammed.

454
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
Toni's father and other parents

455
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,220
and adults also wanted

456
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,220
to support the protest.

457
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,220
They found the children's devices

458
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
very useful.

459
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
With each passing day,

460
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
more and more children and adults

461
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
joined the protest.

462
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,220
The bus driver they had helped

463
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,220
drove up in her bus.

464
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
She honked loudly

465
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
to attract even more people

466
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
to the protest.

467
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,220
The custodian brought

468
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,220
a few friends,

469
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
and Toni's father brought

470
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
his colleagues from work,

471
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,220
all wearing perfectly iron ties.

472
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,220
Even Ms. Gernet came.

473
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
The crowd grew,

474
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220
and after a few weeks,

475
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
there were protests

476
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
not just in Ada's city,

477
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
but also in many cities

478
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,220
throughout the country.

479
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,220
Ada protested in front

480
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
of the Parliament building

481
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
every week,

482
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
even in pouring rain.

483
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,220
On one such rainy day,

484
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
when the president passed

485
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
the group of dripping wet children,

486
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
he couldn't help

487
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
but admire their stubbornness.

488
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
He asked Ada,

489
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,220
"Why do you sit here every day?

490
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
What do you want to achieve?"

491
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Ada replied,

492
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
"We want to determine

493
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
for ourselves

494
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,220
what we can and cannot do

495
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
with our computers."

496
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Her friends shouted in unison,

497
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,220
"Don't wreck our tech!

498
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Don't wreck our tech!"

499
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
And,

500
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
"We want the code!

501
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,220
We want the code!"

502
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,220
The president looked

503
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,220
at the determined faces

504
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
of the children.

505
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
Honestly,

506
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
he too wanted to decide

507
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
for himself

508
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
what the government could

509
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
and couldn't do

510
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,220
with its computers.

511
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
But he didn't understand

512
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,220
anything about computers and code,

513
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
so he had always left that

514
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
to Zangemann.

515
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
Deep in thought,

516
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,220
the president entered the building.

517
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,220
The next day,

518
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,220
the president invited Ada

519
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
and her friends over.

520
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
"We also want to be in charge

521
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,220
of our software ourselves."

522
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,220
In order for that to be true,

523
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
the government must be independent

524
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
from Zangemann.

525
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
"Can you tell me

526
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
what you know about computer programs?"

527
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
he asked them.

528
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,220
Enthusiastically,

529
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
they explained to him

530
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
how software works

531
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
and what you could do with it.

532
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,220
The president was amazed.

533
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,220
With this new knowledge,

534
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
the government would be able

535
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
to design its own software.

536
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,220
The way they wanted,

537
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,220
completely without Zangemann.

538
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Immediately,

539
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,220
the president called his advisors.

540
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
In a large group,

541
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,220
they discussed with the children

542
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
everything they could change

543
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,220
and improve in the software.

544
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
That evening,

545
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
the children went home

546
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,220
proud and satisfied.

547
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,220
Something finally happened.

548
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Their long protest

549
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,220
had been worth it.

550
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
The next morning,

551
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
the president's phone rang

552
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,220
very early.

553
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
It was Zangemann.

554
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,220
He was angrier than ever.

555
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
"Without me,

556
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
the government computers

557
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,220
will no longer work,"

558
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
he threatened.

559
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
But the president

560
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
kept the call short

561
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,220
and quickly hung up.

562
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
The phone rang

563
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
many more times that day,

564
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,220
but Zangemann's calls

565
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
went unanswered.

566
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
The president sat in a meeting

567
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,220
with Ada,

568
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Toni, Marie, Konrad,

569
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,220
and the government experts.

570
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,220
In the days that followed,

571
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,220
they talked from morning to night

572
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
and designed their first programs

573
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,220
for the government's computers.

574
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
They were no longer disturbed

575
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
by Zangemann's calls.

576
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Toni had the good idea

577
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,220
of reprogramming the telephones.

578
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
When Zangemann called,

579
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,220
he only heard

580
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,220
an automated recording.

581
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
The government only wants

582
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
to use software

583
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,220
that it can freely use,

584
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
study,

585
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
share,

586
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,220
and improve.

587
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Thank you for calling.

588
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
Then, after many weeks

589
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,220
of protests and discussions,

590
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
the time had finally come.

591
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
They abolished

592
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
the old Zangemann law.

593
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Instead,

594
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
the government announced,

595
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
"Everyone is allowed

596
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
to program

597
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
their own computers

598
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,220
as long as they adhere

599
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
to the other laws."

600
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,220
In addition,

601
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
a new school subject

602
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
was introduced:

603
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
computer hardware

604
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
and software.

605
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,220
That evening,

606
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,220
everyone celebrated

607
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
with a big party.

608
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,220
Ada, Alan,

609
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Toni, Marie,

610
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
Konrad,

611
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
and other children

612
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
from school

613
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,220
and their parents,

614
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
the president,

615
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Ms. Garnet,

616
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
the bus driver,

617
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
the custodian,

618
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
they were all there.

619
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
They decorated the streets,

620
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
listened to loud music,

621
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
and ate ice cream

622
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,220
as much as they wanted.

623
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,220
And in every imaginable

624
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
shape and color.

625
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
While the others

626
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
continued partying

627
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,220
late into the night,

628
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Ada and her friends

629
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
slipped away

630
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
to their workshop.

631
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,220
They already had

632
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
a lot of ideas

633
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
for new inventions.

634
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,220
And they wanted

635
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
to start right away.

636
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
And Zangemann?

637
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,220
No one's heard

638
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,220
much from him.

639
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,220
Maybe he's still

640
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
sitting angrily

641
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
in front of his

642
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,220
golden computer.

643
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,220
Maybe he doesn't dare

644
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
go out into the street

645
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
anymore.

646
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
and he has boarded up

647
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
all the windows

648
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
of his mansion

649
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
so that he doesn't

650
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
have to worry about

651
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
what other people

652
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
are doing

653
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
with his inventions.

654
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
But maybe he also

655
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
sometimes looks out

656
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
into the world

657
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
through his telescope

658
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
and sees what the children

659
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
are inventing every day.

660
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Perhaps then

661
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
he will remember

662
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
how much fun it was

663
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
for himself

664
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
to tinker

665
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,220
and experiment.

666
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,220
And maybe,

667
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,220
just maybe,

668
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,220
he eats

669
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
pyramid-shaped

670
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
raspberry ice cream

671
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
with rainbow sprinkles.

**Ada & Zangemann: A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream** is a translation of the German original, Ada und Zangemann: Ein Märchen über Software, Skateboards und Himbeereis, published by Dpunkt.verlag in cooperation with O’Reilly Media, Inc., under the imprint “O’REILLY,” © 2022 by Matthias Kirschner and Sandra Brandstätter.

Revision 1.02 20231107

This book by Matthias Kirschner (author) and Sandra Brandstätter (illustrator) is licensed under **Creative Commons CC-BY-SA**, a free cultural license.

**You may** share, copy, and redistribute the material in any medium or format. **You may** adapt, remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially. **You must** give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\
**You may** do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, **you must** distribute your contributions under the same license as the original. (This is a human-readable summary of - and not a substitute for - the “legal code” of CC- BY-SA 4.0.)

Furthermore for remix versions (derivative works), the licensor asks you not to make any modifications of the author's personal acknowledgments and the author's and illustrator's short biographies, instead please completely remove those parts from your remix version.

Publication under this free cultural license was possible due to the great support by dpunkt.verlag GmbH / O'Reilly Media, Inc. for the German book and No Starch Press for the English book. Unfortunately, Creative Commons licenses are still rare exceptions for commercially published books, and often considered revolutionary and risky by publishers.

**A big thank you** to **dpunkt.verlag** and **No Starch Press** for understanding the values of software freedom, taking the time to discuss and understand the advantages of free cultural licenses, and the great support to publish this book under conditions that respect the FSFE's values.

## Grey frame

**Free as in freedom not price**
Free Software is about the freedoms you receive with the software, not about the price. Likewise publishing a book under a free culture license does not mean you have the right to get a gratis copy of the book or ebook. It means you get the rights described above, which enable society to benefit further from this book, as it should from all cultural works.

We encourage you to support authors, publishers, and others involved in the creation of culture under free licenses – including **financially supporting them through purchases or donations**. (https://fsfe.org/donate) Society should support those who respect others' freedom.

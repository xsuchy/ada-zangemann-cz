# Language packs

This directory contains directory structures of 'language packs'. These contain language-specific files like illustrations and font configurations.

The language packs are defined as file structures that can be symlinked.

Language packs that are available or will be created:

- base-ltr: basic language pack, perfect for text-based translations, for left-to-right languages
  - Does not contain images for headings
  - Signs on protest illustration are in English
  - Font configuration contains latin fonts
- blank-ltr: to be used as an override to ensure illustrations without headings, for text-based translations, for left-to-right languages

Many translations have a language pack defined:

- ca_valencia
- de
- es

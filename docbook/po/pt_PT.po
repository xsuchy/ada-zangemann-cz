msgid "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream. By Matthias Kirschner and Sandra Brandstätter. On a mostly desaturated dark cyan background, in a frame composed of sometimes curled white lines that connect a mouse, a keyboard, and a pink smartphone, Ada and Zangemann are facing each other, both with their hands on their hips as a sign of challenge. Ada is smiling and Zangemann is frowning. Ada has black hair collected in two big right- and left-bound ringlets with red rubber bands, and red cheeks. She has little yellow stud earrings. She wears cyan and white horizontal striped shorts and a yellow shirt over a white undershirt that ends with embroidery that goes beyond the shirt. The shirt and undershirt come out over the shorts. Above the shirt Ada wears a blue hoodie. Ada is wearing red shoes with white tips and soles, and short white socks. She has one foot on a skateboard and the other on the ground. Zangemann has short gray hair and square glasses. He is wearing a purple turtle-neck sweater, light blue pants turned up, brown shoes, and white socks. He's wearing a big tech watch. Above Zangemann there are a pair of pliers with red handles crossing the wire frame."

Alan wears blue shorts and he is barefoot. Ada's mom has dark lipstick and long black hair in a white headband. She is wearing a short blue shirt with white trim, white pants, and yellow shoes. Ada's house is built of wood, with the front being white. The roof is dark red corrugated sheeting. There are two windows in front in addition to the door, and another window on the left side.

An antenna on the left of the roof supports a clothesline on which red clothespins hold a green tank top, a pair of light blue pants, and white underpants.

When he was young, computers were huge machines with lots of cables and loud, noisy fans. At school, little Zangemann often dreamed of all the things he would do with computers if they were just a little bit smaller — small enough that they could be built into other fun things. He knew what he would do. First, he would build a computer into his skateboard so that it would make cool noises when he rode it — maybe a fire engine siren or the sound of a rocket launch. Then he would use a computer to invent ice‑cream-making machines! The computer would mix the coolest flavors and even sell the ice cream. There would be machines on every street corner, and he could get ice cream in his favorite flavor whenever he felt like it, and just as much as he wanted. After that, he’d build a cleaning robot and a block-sorting machine so that his room would always be neat and clean. Zangemann had great new ideas like these every day.

IMAGE: Ada & Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry 
Ice Cream.
By Matthias Kirschner and Sandra Brandstätter.
On a mostly desaturated dark cyan background, in a frame composed of 
sometimes curled white lines that connect a mouse, a keyboard, and a 
pink smartphone, Ada and Zangemann are facing each other, both with 
their hands on their hips as a sign of challenge. Ada is smiling and 
Zangemann is frowning.
Ada has black hair collected in two big right- and left-bound ringlets 
with red rubber bands, and red cheeks. She has little yellow stud 
earrings. She wears cyan and white horizontal striped shorts and a 
yellow shirt over a white undershirt that ends with embroidery that goes 
beyond the shirt. The shirt and undershirt come out over the shorts. 
Above the shirt Ada wears a blue hoodie. Ada is wearing red shoes with 
white tips and soles, and short white socks. She has one foot on a 
skateboard and the other on the ground.
Zangemann has short gray hair and square glasses. He is wearing a purple 
turtle-neck sweater, light blue pants turned up, brown shoes, and white 
socks. He's wearing a big tech watch. Above Zangemann there are a pair 
of pliers with red handles crossing the wire frame.

ADA & ZANGEMANN

A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream

## 4 ##
==== Slide 2
[O]nce upon a time, there was a little girl named Ada. Her family was   
so poor that all their savings fit inside a cookie jar. They didn’t have   
enough money to live in a proper home. Instead, Ada lived with her 
mother and her little brother, Alan, in a cabin near a junkyard on the 
edge of town.
[[I:ada-p04
IMAGE: Ada in foreground leaving the house to go to school, in the 
background Ada's house and the junkyard. Ada has a brown backpack with 
yellow shoulder straps.
To the left of Ada there is a red car, a Volkswagen Beetle, without 
wheels and no longer working, with one of the headlights remaining 
attached only with its wires.
On the left, in front of the car, there are two tires, two boxes – one 
of which is a wooden box with an overturned bucket –, and an empty can, 
all among some plants with yellow flowers.
In the background there is Ada's house, with her mother and her brother 
Alan waving goodbye, and the dog sitting on the ground.
Alan is sitting on the two entrance steps of the house. He has short 
dark hair and is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt with a red 
stripe at the edges of the sleeves and two red stripes at the bottom of 
the shirt. Alan wears blue shorts and he is barefoot.
Ada's mom has dark lipstick and long black hair in a white headband. She 
is wearing a short blue shirt with white trim, white pants, and yellow 
shoes.
Ada's house is built of wood, with the front being white. The roof is 
dark red corrugated sheeting. There are two windows in front in addition 
to the door, and another window on the left side. A yellow duck stands 
on top of the roof, while a gray chimney protrudes. An antenna on the 
left of the roof supports a clothesline on which red clothespins hold a 
green tank top, a pair of light blue pants, and white underpants. To the 
right of the house there is a veranda on which there is installed a 
solar panel. Under the veranda there are a mattress, a red oil drum, and 
a gray case.
Behind the house there are piles of landfill objects among which you can 
see a washing machine, a car, and various wooden boards.

]]
Far away, at the other end of town, lived a famous inventor named 
Zangemann.  He was immensely rich. No sheet of paper in the world was 
big enough to show his bank balance with all its numbers and zeros! He 
lived in a huge house with a swimming pool and waterslide, lots of 
staircases and towers, hundreds of windows, and so many rooms that he 
often got lost in them himself. Zangemann’s mansion stood high on a 
hill. From there, he could look out over the whole city.

## 6 ##
==== Slide 3
[C]omputers had fascinated Zangemann ever since he was a child.   
When he was young, computers were huge machines with lots   
of cables and loud, noisy fans. At school, little Zangemann often 
dreamed of all the things he would do with computers if they were just a 
little bit smaller — small enough that they could be built into other 
fun things. He knew what he would do. First, he would build a computer 
into his skateboard so that it would make cool noises when he rode it — 
maybe a fire engine siren or the sound of a rocket launch. Then he would 
use a computer to invent ice‑cream-making machines! The computer would 
mix the coolest flavors and even sell the ice cream. There would be 
machines on every street corner, and he could get ice cream in his 
favorite flavor whenever he felt like it, and just as much as he wanted. 
After that, he’d build a cleaning robot and a block-sorting machine so 
that his room would always be neat and clean. Zangemann had great new 
ideas like these every day. He could think of nothing else.

As the years went by, Zangemann grew bigger and computers got smaller. 
In fact, by the time he finished school, they were so small they fit in 
his pocket. The smallest ones even fit on his fingertip.

[[I:ada-p07
IMAGE: Zangemann as a child on a chair at a school table. From his head 
come six bubbles in which there are his ideas of places in which to 
insert computers: a video call system, a speaker, a washing machine, a 
skateboard with radio control on a big computer monitor, a wrist 
computer, and a shoulder computer with a monitor and keyboard.
Zangemann has gray hair, a dark purple shirt with blue horizontal 
stripes, blue shorts, brown shoes and white socks. He wears glasses and 
a big watch on his left wrist.
On the table there are an open notebook, a yellow pencil, and an eraser, 
while hanging on the side of the table there is his brown briefcase. 
]]

## 8 ##
==== Slide 4
“Finally, I can turn all my ideas into real things!” Zangemann 
exclaimed, and he got right to work. He found ways to put the small 
computers into all kinds of things to make them even more fun and 
useful. And then he sold them.

[[I:ada-p08b
IMAGE: Zangemann original ice cream machine.
It is ice blue in color and is similar to a vending machine of drinks, 
but instead of the cup there is a cone that is filled with ice cream.
Above the dispenser there is a monitor showing the variety that is 
distributed, in this case pineapple ice cream.
On the left there are the slot for inserting coins, the various buttons 
to choose the flavor, and the hole for returning coins.
At the top there is a round white sign with a scoop of candy-pink ice 
cream in a cone.
On the back of the machine there is the refrigeration machinery with the 
“Z” of the Zangemann logo. 
]]
Adults and children loved his inventions. All the kids wanted to have 
one of his skateboards — complete with the latest sounds to show off to 
their friends at school. Kids also loved his speaker invention, which 
could instantly play any song you requested. And, of course, everyone 
loved the ice cream served every afternoon from the automatic, 
extra-delicious Original Zangemann Ice Cream Machine. It all seemed like 
magic, but the secret was simple: the little computers that Zangemann 
built into his machines made it all possible.
[[I:ada-p08a

[[I:ada-p09
IMAGE: Ada tinkers with objects in her improvised lab.
Ada is sitting on an overturned water case, and working on a repair with 
a yellow screwdriver. Also on the table are green pliers, a red hammer, 
a white power strip, and another gadget. Ada is at a table consisting of 
a wooden board supported by two oil drums (one gray and one red) and a 
small wooden sawhorse. Behind Ada there are a washing machine, pipes, 
and a board. In front of the improvised table there are tires and an old 
phone with faulty wire. Alan is coming toward Ada holding a yellow fan 
over his head. Alan now wears white socks and yellow shoes. 
]]
These inventions were very popular at Ada’s school, and many of her 
friends rode around on the cool skateboards. Ada was often sad, since 
her mother couldn’t buy her any of those great things: no skateboard, no 
speakers, no ice cream.
==== Slide 5
Luckily, Ada lived right next to the junkyard. There were lots of broken 
gadgets and rusty parts, which she put together to make cool new things, 
like a soapbox she and Alan rode roaring down the hill, a windmill, and 
scary junk monsters, which she and Alan would fight together. She also 
found many useful items—an old cell phone, for example. The screen was 
cracked, but she could fix that, and while there wasn’t internet at the 
junkyard, she could get access somewhere else.

Ada had so much fun tinkering in the junkyard and fixing broken things 
that she forgot all about the skateboards and the ice cream.

## 10 ##
==== Slide 6
Because everyone bought his inventions, Zangemann soon became the 
richest person in the whole world. With all his money, he bought a huge 
golden computer with a keyboard made of jewels and set it up in the 
largest room of his mansion. From there, over the internet, he could 
control all the little computers built into his inventions.

All he had to do was press the proper key on the golden computer, and 
immediately all the ice-cream machines in town would dispense only 
vanilla ice cream. If Zangemann wanted people to eat chocolate ice 
cream, he pressed the key for chocolate ice cream. If he gave the order 
for lemon ice cream, the machines made only lemon ice cream. Zangemann 
loved his inventions and was always thrilled at how amazingly well his 
machines worked. Sometimes people were disappointed when their favorite 
flavor wasn’t available, but what could they do? After all, there was 
ice cream on every street corner.
[[I:ada-p10

has 3 sockets and a green switch. One of the sockets is attached to a 
plug with a gray cable. 
]]

** 11 **

Zangemann had a lot of fun pressing the sparkling keys and  
watching people eat ice cream. He spent many hours every  
day in front of his golden computer doing this. Again  
and again, he looked down on the city through a  
long telescope, observing how reliably his  
inventions carried out his commands.
[[I:ada-p11

armchair with a very tall red padded backrest at whose top is the “Z” of 
the Zangemann logo. He is wearing a purple turtle-neck sweater and light 
blue trousers.

has the logo on the back. It is integrated into a costly wooden desk 
from which a gray cable flows that is connected to the power strip of 
the previous page. 
]]

## 12 ##
==== Slide 7
When he wasn’t sitting at his golden computer, Zangemann was building 
his little computers into new devices and then selling those. He built 
washing machines that sent a message to your cell phone when your 
laundry was done.  He made vacuums that played happy music instead of 
droning loudly. He invented light bulbs that turned on and off at the 
snap of a finger and cars that told you where the nearest grocery store 
was.
[[I:ada-p12
IMAGE: City landscape with houses and shops, with a central street 
turning right. On the road there are a car and a cyclist.
There are various children and adults walking or going on skateboards, 
some eating ice cream, while others are buying ice cream from the 
original Zangemann machines. 
]]
Soon, almost every appliance in the world had a Zangemann computer built 
into it. Not all of his inventions seemed necessary at first, but people 
bought everything he made. That’s just the way it was. Everyone wanted 
the devices made by Zangemann, the greatest inventor in the world.

** 13 **

One day Zangemann thought, “Today I want to see my inventions up close.”  
He put away his big telescope, then climbed down the many stairs of  
his mansion and ventured out into the city, full of anticipation at  
the thought of enjoying his cool devices.
[[I:ada-p13
IMAGE: Zangemann descends the stairs from his mansion on the hill 
towards the city.
Zangemann's house stands on a hill. The front is blue with large 
windows; the towers are dark blue, and from a window starts a yellow 
slide that ends in a large swimming pool with two palm trees. The roofs 
are red, and above the highest tower an antenna is installed.
On the sides of the stairs to get off the hill there are evergreen 
trees. 
]]

## 14 ##

“Maybe a little trip might even give me a few new ideas. If I’m 
completely honest, my last inventions weren’t quite as useful as the 
first ones... ,” Zangemann pondered. “But my ice-cream machines are and 
will remain second to none,” he thought immediately afterward, and not 
without pride, as he passed a group of people all eating coconut ice 
cream, the flavor of the day.
==== Slide 8
He was completely absorbed in his thoughts when suddenly — BAM! — 
something crashed into his shin.
[[I:ada-p14
IMAGE: Zangemann after the incident with the child. Zangemann screams 
from pain while holding up one of his legs with both hands at the shin.
The child has brown hair that is blown back by Zangemann's scream; he is 
wearing a light blue hooded sweatshirt and dark green pants. He holds a 
red Zangemann electric skateboard. 
]]

** 15 **

Zangemann yelped and looked around for the cause. A startled child stood 
in front of him, holding an original Zangemann skateboard under his arm. 
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to do that,” the child stammered, but Zangemann 
wasn’t listening.

An angry Zangemann limped away. Suddenly, he heard loud music. He had 
never before heard something so horrible. He looked around and saw that 
the music was coming from a loudspeaker he himself had constructed. A 
child across the street was holding it. The child seemed to like the 
music, but it gave Zangemann a terrible headache, and his mood worsened. 
This was not how he had imagined his walk!

with a collar and tag. 
]]

## 16 ##
==== Slide 9
Zangemann was so furious with the two children. How dare they use his 
inventions this way? That night, he couldn’t sleep, so he sat down at 
his golden computer. From there, he gave all the little computers in the 
skateboards a command that they were no longer allowed to go on 
sidewalks. He ordered the small computers in the speakers to play music 
only at a low volume, except for his favorite music, which he 
immediately turned on to get into a better mood.

==== Slide 10
[T]he next day, there was a big commotion at Ada’s school. On the way to   
school, the kids’ skateboards had stopped working. The wheels simply   
stood still. And the children could no longer turn up the volume on 
their speakers. What was going on?
[[I:ada-p18
IMAGE: Five kids from the school who can't make skateboards work. Two 
girls wear helmets, respectively blue and red. A little girl with brown 
hair tied in two tails with yellow rubber bands is kneeling. She is

helmet does not work. Four children have backpacks on their shoulders, 
while the little girl with the red helmet left hers leaning on a bench 
on which there are a yellow apple and a light blue bottle with a white 
flower on it. 
]]

** 19 **

Although she didn’t own any of these things, Ada wondered why the 
skateboards and the speakers suddenly stopped working. But she didn’t 
really have time to think much about it, because she was tinkering 
again.  She put together a complete bicycle from the parts of three 
broken bicycles.  She gave the bicycle to her mother as a present so 
that she wouldn’t have to spend her money on bus tickets to work. For 
her brother, Ada built a loudspeaker so he could fall asleep to nice 
stories in the evenings when their mother was still at work.

[[I:ada-p19
IMAGE: Close-up of Ada thoughtful, with a backpack and with one hand on 
her chin and the other resting on her side. 
]]
After a few days, the initial shock at Ada’s  
school was forgotten. The skateboards  
still didn’t go on the sidewalk, but  
apart from that, they still worked.  
And so now the children rode in  
circles around the playground and  
listened to soft music. Only a strange,  
pompous marching music continued  
to play at an unchanged volume, which  
the children found rather puzzling.

## 20 ##
==== Slide 11
[A]da loved Wednesdays. Every Wednesday, her mother and Alan would   
pick her up from school, and they would all go to the library together.   
Ada was always drawn to the technology section. There were books with 
blueprints, instructions for experiments, and explanations of how 
different devices worked. In the library, Ada could also go online with 
her cell phone. She quickly realized that there was also much to 
discover on the internet. There, many people shared their ideas and 
repair tips to help others.

On one of those afternoons, Ada learned two new words: hardware and 
software.  Hardware was a word for something Ada already knew: the 
electronic devices she tinkered with after school, or those devices she 
could hold in her hands and try to fix or make into something else. What 
was completely new to Ada was the word software. She soon learned that 
it meant instructions that ran on a computer to control other devices or 
computers. Some books called those instructions programs or code. With 
such a computer program, one could, for example, tell a loudspeaker 
which song to play and how loud.

The best thing about Ada’s new discovery was realizing that she could 
tinker with software just as she could with hardware. Hardware is built 
with tools — hammers, drills, and screws. Software is built simply by 
writing down the commands for the hardware, one after the other. There 
was a separate language for this — the programming language. With 
software, Ada could make her inventions even more useful. She really 
wanted to learn the programming language!

** 21 **

[[I:ada-p21
IMAGE: Computer screen from which the elements of the programming 
language symbolically emerge: “while num > 0“, “init“, “sx=42“, “for“, 
“v**3“.

hand enters the screen to change the program (“print(msg)”, “a+b+c+d=e”, 
“if”, “break”, “continue”, “exit()“). Next to the keyboard there are a 
pencil and an eraser. 
]]

## 22 ##
==== Slide 12
[O]ver the next few weeks, Ada spent her afternoons in the library.   
She found books and websites that explained how programming   
languages and code worked. For Ada, it felt a bit like learning a secret 
language, or like studying vocabulary in school. Ada ate it all up. She 
expected her first program to do something simple: “Make this lamp 
blink!”

Of course, she wanted to try her program out right away to see if it 
really worked. At the junkyard, she connected her cell phone to a small 
LED lamp. Then she typed the lines of code into her cell phone.

At first, nothing happened. Ada wondered where the error could be. She 
made a few small changes and tried again and .... “Yeesss!” The little 
light began to flash. On, off, on, off. Ada looked at the LED in 
amazement. She had written her first program!

Ada was totally thrilled. She imagined all the great things she could 
do. If she just entered the right code, she could make her inventions do 
exactly what she wanted. It was not so easy, but after a few weeks, Ada 
wrote a truly useful program: one that would make Alan’s speakers 
automatically turn off half an hour after he had fallen asleep.

** 23 **

[[I:ada-p23

a power strip with a gray wire and plug.
On the table there are also: 3 books, of which one is open; a clipboard 
and a pencil; pliers; glue; solder; and a disconnected soldering iron. 
]]
Ada also had an idea for the next program she would write. It was a 
bigger deal, a real project. She would probably need the whole summer 
break for it... And she could hardly wait!

==== Slide 13
[Z]angemann had slept horribly every night since his terrible walk in the   
city. When he went to bed each night, worries plagued him. “Oh no, my   
marvelous inventions. It can’t be that everyone just plays around with 
them. All the things that could go wrong! I put so much thought into 
everything, down to the last detail.” Zangemann pondered and pondered 
and tossed and turned sleeplessly in his bed all night.

Waking up one morning with a deeply furrowed brow, he made a decision. 
He needed to make a change. Zangemann sat down at his computer and wrote 
one program after another. In these programs, he specified exactly what 
his inventions were to do and were not to do under any circumstances. 
The chaos had to stop!

Once he was done, he sent all the new programs from his golden computer 
to people’s devices. He ordered his speakers to play only his favorite 
music whenever he was within earshot. He programmed the ice-cream 
machines to stop selling ice cream in the afternoon. After all, he 
didn’t want his expensive clothes to get stained by ice cream while he 
was out for a walk. All day long he sat at the computer and typed and 
typed and typed...

[S]ummer break was already halfway over. Ada stood in front of her big   
project and scratched her head. She had built a skateboard from old parts   
and then connected a motor to make the wheels turn. With a motorized 
skateboard, Ada could zoom to the library or the junkyard even faster 
after school. Super practical! But it didn’t work. When she stood on it 
and pressed the Go! button, the wheels moved, but way too fast. Ada fell 
off the skateboard every time she started. No matter what she tried, she 
just couldn’t get it right.

After falling on her bottom for the hundredth time, she went back to the 
library.  She always found answers to her questions there. And indeed, 
on the internet, she came across a program that someone had written for 
an electric scooter that also needed to start slowly. Ada downloaded it 
to her phone.

Back at the junkyard, she adapted some lines of code for her skateboard 
program. She tweaked a few things and kept tinkering.

Several failed attempts later, on the last day of summer break, the time 
had finally come. Ada stood on the skateboard and pressed the Go! 
button, and the skateboard started moving, slowly at first, then faster. 
It worked! She tried to brake. It worked! Ada let out a cry of joy and 
took a trip to the park.

skateboard is blue, with gray and pink wheels; the electronic part is 
placed above the skateboard (as opposed to Zangemann's skateboards where 
the electronic part is below). Ada is holding in both hands a remote 
control with a short antenna to maneuver it.
Behind Ada are Marie and Toni who carry their own skateboards under 
their arms and look with amazement at Ada, who has shot past them and in 
front of them.
Marie has dark long hair with two braids fastened with orange clips, 
yellow earrings, a fuchsia shirt with white sleeves with purple 
horizontal stripes, a white skirt, white and yellow sneakers, white 
socks, a white hat with yellow sides, and a light purple backpack. Marie 
has a blue artificial leg. Her skateboard is blue with yellow wheels.
Toni has red hair closely trimmed on the sides. He is wearing a blue 
sweatshirt, dark green pants, and white shoes. He has a red backpack 
with white inserts and shoulder straps. One hand is next to his mouth. 
His skateboard is purple with orange wheels.
There's also a father with his son walking in the opposite direction: 
the father is dressed in a blue checked jacket and blue pants and holds 
a brown briefcase. He is smiling at Ada.
His son has a blue shirt, blue shorts, white shoes, a brown backpack, 
and a red and white hat. He holds under his arm a yellow Zangemann 
skateboard with light brown wheels, and he grins at Ada.
In the background there is a bakery with large windows through which you 
can see the bread. It has a green and white striped awning around the 
corner and a sign on the sidewalk with the list of products. Overhead, a 
large pretzel is displayed.
On the road there is a puddle that reflects the blue of the sky.

==== Slide 15
When Ada rode her skateboard to school on the first day back after 
summer break, the other children were amazed. During recess, Ada’s 
curious classmates surrounded her.

“How can you ride your skateboard on the sidewalk?” they asked.
[[I:ada-p28

one end. She is pointing to Ada's skateboard and she's talking.
Next to her is Konrad, with short blond hair, a dark gray helmet,

with white cuffs, and gray shoes with white soles. He has a red 
skateboard with orange wheels.
Behind Ada there are 4 other children. On the other end Toni is smiling. 
He touches his chin with one hand while with the other he holds a yellow 
helmet by the laces.

** 29 **

Ada thought for a moment, then said, “I don’t think it’s your 
skateboards but actually the software in them. It’s probably programmed 
into the software that the skateboards aren’t allowed to go on the 
sidewalk. But that can be changed!”

That evening, Ada tested out her theory on her classmate Toni’s 
skateboard.  She worked secretly through most of the night, and the next 
day, Toni could ride on the sidewalk again. Unfortunately, his 
skateboard could no longer make the sounds that his parents had bought 
from Zangemann. Instead, every 10 minutes it made a strange noise that 
sounded like a drawn-out burp.  Ada knew that little errors like that 
could pop up in programs all the time. But Toni’s burping skateboard was 
really quite funny.

==== Slide 16
[M]ore and more children started to visit Ada at the junkyard after school,   
and she helped them rewrite the programs in their skateboards.   
Some of her classmates were very excited about this new discovery. It 
was unbelievable what you could do with software code! They wanted to 
learn everything Ada knew about programming languages, and soon they 
were riding their skateboards again, wherever they wanted to.
==== Slide 17
But that wasn’t all. With the software, they could give their 
skateboards new, cool features. Marie attached colorful LED lights to 
her board that glowed different colors depending on the speed. Konrad 
built old propellers onto his skateboard for extra speed.

Ada, Toni, Marie, and Konrad spent many afternoons at the junkyard. They 
even set up a real workshop where they could fine-tune their programs 
for hours, listening all the while to music from the speakers Ada had 
built for Alan.

“Your brother’s speakers are much louder than ours,” remarked Toni, who 
was busy attaching a speedometer to his helmet.
“I’m sure that’s also because of the software,” Marie said.

Together, they changed the software for the speakers too. Then they 
turned up the music as loud as possible and danced wildly together.

==== Slide 18
[E]very day, Ada and her friends made plans together for the afternoon.   
From a broken ice-cream machine, they built a new one that could make   
ice cream in every imaginable shape and color. They ate square ice 
cream, heart-shaped ice cream, and even pyramid-shaped ice cream, as 
well as strawberry, raspberry, and rainbow ice cream, all with sprinkles 
and hot fudge — much better than the varieties from the Zangemann 
machines.

Sometimes they could even help adults. Toni reprogrammed his father’s 
ironing machine so that it could also iron ties again — Zangemann had 
forbidden the machines to do so because he hated ties like the plague. 
For the bus driver, they built an automatic watering system out of old 
hoses and a computer so that her plants would not die of thirst during 
summer days. And they helped the school custodian modify his vacuum so 
that it automatically recognized toys and wouldn’t suck them up.

Some things they built just for fun, like the fart machine they put in 
their math teacher’s chair. Whenever Ms. Gernet sat down, the machine 
played a little fart sound. The teacher would scold them, but Ada was 
sure that she secretly smirked a little every time.

## 36 ##
==== Slide 19
[O]ne day, Zangemann noticed that some computers no longer obeyed   
his programming commands. Shocked and fuming with anger, he   
called the president. In a quivering voice, Zangemann yelled, “Someone 
is rewriting the programs in my devices. That can’t happen; after all, 
they are my inventions. It’s far too dangerous if everyone can do 
whatever they want with the computers. You must make a law against 
this!”

The president did not want to upset Zangemann. All the government’s 
computers were programmed by Zangemann. Without the computers, the 
government would not be able to run the country. So they passed the law 
as Zangemann 
requested:

“All computers that do not listen to Zangemann are banned. Anyone who 
reprograms Zangemann’s devices will be fined 500,000 gold pieces!”

The president has white hair and wears a light blue shirt, a red tie, 
and a blue jacket with yellow buttons.
The President is sitting on a green chair with white vertical lines, and 
his other hand is on the desk. On the desk, in addition to the 
videophone, there are sheets with something written on them and an open

two olives on a toothpick, over a blue napkin with white stripes.

==== Slide 20
When Ada and her friends heard this, they were furious. “This is 
unfair,” they 
said. “We rebuilt and reprogrammed our skateboards ourselves. They are 
much 
better now. We won’t let anyone take that away from us!”

They gathered in front of one of their rebuilt ice-cream machines and 
discussed 
the situation. It was clear that something had to be done about the new 
law, and 
they made a plan...

==== Slide 21
[T]he next day, they didn’t go to school. Instead, they rode their   
skateboards to the parliament building, with large protest signs   
under their arms, and sat down in front of the building. The evening 
before, they had put LED lights on some of the signs, which were now 
flashing brightly. They had connected their speakers together so 
everyone in the street could hear what they were saying. Some passersby 
stopped and asked the children what they were demonstrating for.
“For software freedom!” they replied in unison and told the adults their 
story.  Impressed, the adults nodded, and the president also looked 
curiously at their signs as he approached the building.

On the following day, Ada and her friends again sat down in front of the 
parliament building, this time with support. Some classmates came whose 
skateboards Ada had reprogrammed. Toni’s father and other parents and 
adults also wanted to support the protest. They found the children’s 
devices very useful.

## 40 ##

With each passing day, more and more children and adults joined the 
protest.  The bus driver they had helped drove up in her bus. She honked 
loudly to attract even more people to the protest. The custodian brought 
a few friends, and Toni’s father brought his colleagues from work, all 
wearing perfectly ironed ties. Even Ms. Gernet came. The crowd grew, and 
after a few weeks, there were protests not just in Ada’s city but also 
in many cities throughout the country.
[[I:ada-p40-41

[A]da protested in front of the parliament building every week, even in   
pouring rain. On one such rainy day, when the president passed the group   
of dripping-wet children, he couldn’t help but admire their 
stubbornness. He asked Ada, “Why do you sit here every day? What do you 
want to achieve?” Ada replied, “We want to determine for ourselves what 
we can and cannot do with our computers.” Her friends shouted in unison: 
“Don’t wreck our tech! Don’t wreck our tech!” and “We want the code! We 
want the code!”

The president looked at the determined faces of the children. Honestly, 
he, too, wanted to decide for himself what the government could and 
couldn’t do with its computers. But he didn’t understand anything about 
computers and code, so he had always left that to Zangemann. Deep in 
thought, the president entered the building.
==== Slide 22
[[I:ada-p42

air is typing on a laptop. He has wavy brown hair parted in the center,

computer there are a green cup and two open books. 
]]
The next day, the president invited Ada and her friends over. “We also 
want to be in charge of our software ourselves. In order for that to be 
true, the government must be independent from Zangemann. Can you tell me 
what you know about computer programs?” he asked them. Enthusiastically, 
they explained to him how software works and what you could do with it. 
The president was amazed.

** 43 **

With this new knowledge, the government would be able to design its own 
software, the way it wanted — completely without Zangemann. Immediately, 
the president called his advisers. In a large group, they discussed with 
the children everything they could change and improve in the software.

That evening, the children went home proud and satisfied. Something 
finally happened! Their long protest was worth it.
[[I:ada-p43

## 44 ##

[T]he next morning, the president’s phone rang very early. It was   
Zangemann. He was angrier than ever. “Without me, the government   
computers will no longer work,” he threatened. But the president kept 
the call short and quickly hung up. The phone rang many more times that 
day, but Zangemann’s calls went unanswered. The president sat in a 
meeting with Ada, Toni, Marie, Konrad, and the government experts.

[[I:ada-p44
IMAGE: A herald, wearing a hat with a plume, playing a trumpet on which 
a red banner is hung. 
]]
In the days that followed, they talked from morning to night and designed their  
first programs for the government’s computers. They were no longer disturbed  
by Zangemann’s calls. Toni had the good idea of reprogramming  
the telephones. When Zangemann called, he  
only heard an automated recording: “The  
government only wants to use software  
that it can freely use, study, share, and  
improve. Thank you for calling.”
==== Slide 23
Then, after many weeks of protests and  
discussions, the time had finally come:  
they abolished the old Zangemann law!  
Instead, the government announced:

** 45 **

“Everyone is allowed to program their own computers as long as they 
adhere to the other laws.”

In addition, a new school subject was introduced: computer hardware and 
software.

That evening, everyone celebrated with a big party. Ada, Alan, Toni, 
Marie, Konrad, and other children from school and their parents; the 
president; Ms. Gernet; the bus driver; the custodian — they were all 
there. They decorated the streets, listened to loud music, and ate ice 
cream, as much as they wanted, and in every imaginable shape and color.

[A]nd Zangemann? No one’s heard much from him. Maybe he’s still sitting   
angrily in front of his golden computer. Maybe he doesn’t dare go out   
into the street anymore and has boarded up all the windows of his 
mansion so that he doesn’t have to worry about what other people are 
doing with his inventions. But maybe he also sometimes looks out into 
the world through his telescope and sees what the children are inventing 
every day. Perhaps then he will remember how much fun it was for himself 
to tinker and experiment. And maybe, just maybe, he eats pyramid-shaped 
raspberry ice cream with rainbow sprinkles.

[T]he inventor Zangemann is world-famous and immensely rich. Adults and 
children alike love his fabulous technical inventions. But one day there 
is a problem: the children's electronic skateboards no longer work 
properly. What’s going on? The curious girl Ada sees through what is 
going on. Together with her friends, she experiments with hardware and 
software, and the children forge a plan: Zangemann can no longer be the 
only one in control of the devices!

A book that arouses interest in tinkering and encourages shaping 
technology.

This are the sources for the illustrated children's book "Ada &
Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards and Raspberry Ice
Cream".

The book tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl
Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and
software, and in the process realises how crucial it is for her and
others to control technology. Here the short summary:

> The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above the
> city. Adults and children alike love his inventions and are desperate
> to have them. But then something happens: when Zangemann once again
> wants to take a close-up look at his inventions during a walk through
> the city and, with a loud thud, a child riding a skateboard hits him
> in the shin! Enraged, the inventor makes a momentous decision... The
> clever girl Ada sees through it all. Together with her friends, she
> forges a plan.

Publication under this free cultural license was possible due to the
great support by dpunkt.verlag GmbH / O'Reilly for the German book and
No Starch Press for the English book. Unfortunately Creative Commons
licenses are still rare exceptions for commercial published books, and
often considered revolutionary and risky by publishers.

**A big thank you to dpunkt.verlag and No Starch Press for understanding
the values of software freedom, taking the time to discuss and
understand the advantages of free cultural licenses, and the great
support to publish this book under conditions that respect the FSFE's
values.**

# Profits of sales

Matthias Kirschner wrote the text on a voluntary basis for the FSFE. All
author revenues of book and ebook sales go directly to the non-profit
Free Software Foundation Europe. The FSFE paid the illustrator Sandra
Brandstätter and the children's book editor Wiebke Helmchen for their
work. Linuxhotel GmbH made the project possible by already agreeing at
the beginning of the writing process, to buy 1000 copies once the book
was finished.

For the Italian edition, Luca Bonissi donated more than 2000 copies to the FSFE
and he sets all revenues of the books and eBooks sales to go directly to the
FSFE.

# Free as in freedom not price

Free Software is about the freedoms you receive with the software, not
about the price. Likewise publishing a book under a free culture license
does not mean you have the right to get a gratis copy of the book or
ebook. It means you get the rights described above, which enable society
to benefit further from it, as all culture should.

We encourage you to support authors, publishers, and others involved in
the creation of culture under free licenses -- **including financially
supporting them through purchases or
[donations](https://fsfe.org/donate)**. Society should support those who
respect others freedom.

# Terms

Definitions of terms used in the automation. Listed here to achieve consistency
in the wording in code, documentation and conversation.

- **Format:** specific form of presentation in which the story is told,
  regardless of language. Current formats: print with different covers, screen
  pdf, digibook, epub, kamisihibai and bilingual book.
- **Edition:** version of the book edited in a certain way.
- **Language:** language in which the book is written.
- **Locale:** specific language and region for which the book is written.
  Language code can have a locale suffix to express the target region, like
  `pt_PT` for Portuguese in Portugal, compared to `pt_BR` for Brazilian
  Portuguese.
- **Script (or [writing
  system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system)):** set of symbols to
  represent a language. Some languages can be written in multiple scripts and a
  script can represent multiple languages.
- **[Colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)):** a brief
  statement containing information about the publication of a book, including
  the imprint.
- **Imprint (or [impressum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressum)):** legally
  required statement of ownership (copyright) and authorship of the book. The
  colophon carries the imprint information.
- **[Drop cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial#Types_of_initial):** a type
  of initial where the letter is located within the paragrpah margins.
- **Translator:** person translating the text into another language or script.
- **Proofreader:** person checking the translation.
- **Publisher:** organization making the book available. Often takes care of
  printing and distribution. Some publishers facilitate self-publishing by merely
  acting as a proxy to the printer and distributor.
- **Printer:** organization printing the book.
- **Distributor:** organization distributing the book. This can include
  warehousing and making it available to book stores.
- **[Offset printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_printing):** a
  printing technique using rollers for low printing cost at high volumes. It
  costs more time to set up, so it becomes a reasonable option from about 1000
  books and becomes cost-effective at about 2000 books.
- **Print on demand (or POD):** printing books when needed, piece by piece,
  using digital printing techniques. Typically at a lower quality and higher
  cost then high-volume offset printing. The non-existent inventory cost, low
  risk and international availability can be a reasons to choose print on
  demand. Some print on demand services also offer short print runs.
- **Short print run:** printing multiple but still low volumes (tens or
  hundreds) of books using digital printing techniques. This holds a middle
  ground between print on demand and offset printing.
- **[ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN):** a numeric book identifier.
  Each edition requires a unique ISBN. Same identifier as used in the barcode.

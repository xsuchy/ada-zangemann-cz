# Terms

Definitions of terms used in the automation. Listed here to achieve consistency
in wording and to help you communicate clearly with professionals.

- **Format:** specific form of presentation in which the story is told,
  regardless of language. Current formats: print with different covers, screen
  pdf, digibook, epub, kamisihibai and bilingual book.
- **Edition:** version of the book edited in a certain way.
- **Language:** language in which the book is written.
- **Locale:** specific language and region for which the book is written.
  Language code can have a locale suffix to express the target region, like
  `pt_PT` for Portuguese in Portugal, compared to `pt_BR` for Brazilian
  Portuguese.
- **Script (or [writing
  system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system)):** set of symbols to
  represent a language. Some languages can be written in multiple scripts and a
  script can represent multiple languages.
- **[Colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)):** a brief
  statement containing information about the publication of a book, including
  the imprint.
- **Imprint (or [impressum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressum)):** legally
  required statement of ownership (copyright) and authorship of the book. The
  colophon carries the imprint information.
- **[Drop cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial#Types_of_initial):** a type
  of initial where the letter is located within the paragrpah margins.
- **Translator:** person translating the text into another language or script.
- **Proofreader:** person checking the translation.
- **Publisher:** organization making the book available. Often takes care of
  printing and distribution. Some publishers facilitate self-publishing by merely
  acting as a proxy to the printer and distributor.
- **Printer:** organization printing the book.
- **Distributor:** organization distributing the book. This can include
  warehousing and making it available to book stores.
- **[Offset printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_printing):** a
  printing technique using rollers for low printing cost at high volumes. It
  costs more time to set up, so it becomes a reasonable option from about 1000
  books and becomes cost-effective at about 2000 books.
- **Print on demand (or POD):** printing books when needed, piece by piece,
  using digital printing techniques. Typically at a lower quality and higher
  cost then high-volume offset printing. The non-existent inventory cost, low
  risk and international availability can be a reasons to choose print on
  demand. Some print on demand services also offer short print runs.
- **Short print run:** printing multiple but still low volumes (tens or
  hundreds) of books using digital printing techniques. This holds a middle
  ground between print on demand and offset printing.
- **[ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN):** a numeric book identifier. The
  barcode contains the ISBN. Each edition with a textual revision or a different
  format (hardcover, softcover, ebook) requires a unique ISBN.
- **[Title page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_page):** page at the
  beginning of the book that displays the title, subtitle and author, much like
  the cover but inside the book.
- **[Recto and verso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recto_and_verso):** define
  the front (recto) and back (verso) of the pages in a book. For a left-to-right
  language the recto is on the right and the verso is on the left. For
  right-to-left languages this is reversed.
- **[Page spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design#Page_spread):** two
  pages next to each other (a recto and verso) like how the book would lay open.
  Books are often designed in spreads to consider the point of the viewer where
  to pages can be seen at the same time. Some illustrations cover both pages of
  the spread.

# Readings Organisation

Translations available: [Portuguese](Readings-Organisation_PT_pt.md)

## Recommended Materials

* Projector or digital screen: to present the illustrations, which is
  highly recommended, rather than just reading it without the illustrations.
* Headset microphone: so you have your hands available to hold the book
  and a presenter to switch the slides.
* Have some stickers and other material with you for the audience. You
  can order it free of charge [from the FSFE](https://fsfe.org/promo),
  just mention there you do an Ada & Zangemann reading and how many
  attendants you expect. 

## Considerations for the location

* Have a location with few distractions. Readings in "open spaces"
  turned out to be more challenging for the reader, and especially
  younger children are way more distracted by noise or movement in
  another area of the room.
* For smaller readings, try to create a cosy environment so not to have
  too much space between you and the audience. For example, making the
  audience sit on the floor on pillows, with the reader in front of
  them.

## Discussion with participants

### During the story

* After reading the paragraph "But that wasnâ€™t all. With the software,
  they could give their skateboards new, cool features. Marie attached
  colorful LED lights to her board that glowed different colors
  depending on the speed. Konrad built old propellers onto his
  skateboard for extra speed." it is a good time for a short round to
  ask children what ideas they have for inventions. A lot of great ideas
  often come up. After some ideas mentioned by them, you can then say
  "let's see what they come up with" and continue with the reading.

### After finishing the story

* Brief interaction:
  * To break the ice, you can ask them about their favourite ice cream
    and what they would like to invent for the future. 
* Medium interactions:
  * There were also interesting discussions when you asked them what
    computers they know (computers in loudspeakers, phones, laptops,
    cars, planes, elevators, ... -- you could show the double page with
    the different Zangemann devices), if they experienced problems with
    computers in the past, and how they dealt with those problems.
* Longer interactions. Ask them how they would feel in the following
  situations:
  * Someone else builds a house of bricks. You realise there is a 
    brick missing in the house which makes it unstable, and you would
    like to fix it. But the other child does not allow you to do so. How
    do you feel about it?
  * Someone else builds a fantastic machine to sort bricks. You would
    also love to build such a machine, but the other child does not want
    to tell you how it was done. 
  * You build a mansion with bricks, it is awesome, and the other
    children also love it. While you are out of the room, another child
    builds a great additional tower for the mansion. It is now even
    greater than before and the other children are also very impressed. 
  * If someone could share something with you, while they could also
    still posses it themselves, would it be OK for the other person not
    to share the thing with you? 
* Exercises: 
  * Ask the children to write a letter to Zangemann and tell him how you
    feel about his behaviour. We [published a list of letters for which
    the parents and the teacher gave us an
    approval](https://fsfe.org/activities/ada-zangemann/letters.html).
    If your children also want to write a letter to Zangemann, please
    send us your letter, let us know if you are OK with us publishing
    it, and we will ensure he gets it!

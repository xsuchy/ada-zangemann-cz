OBRÁZEK: Ada a Zangemann - Příběh o softwaru, skateboardech a malinové zmrzlině
od Matthiase Kirschnera a Sandry Brandstätterové.
Na převážně vybledlém tmavě tyrkysovém pozadí, v rámečku tvořeném místy zakroucenými bílými linkami, které spojují myš, klávesnici a růžový smartphone, stojí proti sobě Ada a Zangemann oba s rukama v bok na znamení vzdoru. Ada se usmívá a Zangemann se mračí.
Ada má červené tváře a černé vlasy má na pravé a levé straně stažené červenými gumičkami do dvou velkých drdolů. V uších má malé žluté pecičkové náušnice. Je oblečena v kraťasech s vodorovnými tyrkysovými a bílými pruhy, pod žlutým tričkem jí vykukuje krajkovaný lem bílého nátělníku. Tričko i košilka jsou vytažené přes kraťasy. Přes tričko má Ada oblečenou modrou mikinu s kapucí. Na nohou má červené boty s bílými špičkami a podrážkami a nízké bílé ponožky. Jednou nohou stojí na skateboardu a druhou na zemi.
Zangemann má krátké šedé vlasy a hranaté brýle. Na sobě má fialový rolák, světle modré kalhoty s ohrnutými nohavicemi, hnědé boty a bílé ponožky. Na ruce nosí velké moderní hodinky. Nad Zangemannem jsou kleště s červenými rukojeťmi, které přetínají rámeček z bílé linky.

==== Slide 2
[B]yla jednou jedna malá holčička jménem Ada. Její rodina byla tak chudá, že všechny jejich úspory se vešly do plechovky od sušenek. Neměli peníze ani na to, aby mohli bydlet v opravdovém bytě. Místo toho bydlela Ada se svou maminkou a malým bratrem Alanem v chatrči poblíž vrakoviště na kraji města.
[[I:ada-p04
OBRÁZEK: V popředí odchází Ada z domu do školy, v pozadí je její dům a
vrakoviště. Ada má hnědý batoh se žlutými popruhy.
Nalevo od Ady je červené auto, Volkswagen Brouk, bez kol a jenom s jedním
světlometem, který už visí jenom na drátech.
Nalevo před autem leží dvě pneumatiky a dvě krabice. Jedna z nich je
dřevěná s převráceným kbelíkem, prázdnou plechovkou, mezi nějakými rostlinami
se žlutými květy.
V pozadí je Adina chatrč a maminka s bratrem, kteří ji mávají na rozloučenou.
Na zemi před nimi sedí pes.
Alan sedí na dvou schodcích do domku. Má krátké tmavé vlasy a je oblečený
do bílého trička s krátkými rukávy olemovanými červeným lemem a dvěma červenými
pásky na spodním okraji trička. Alan má modré kraťasy a je naboso.
Adina máma má tmavou rtěnku a černé vlasy svázané bílou stuhou. Má krátké
modré tričko s bílým zakončením, bílé kalhoty a žluté boty.
Adina chatrč je dřevěná s bílou přední stěnou. Střecha je z tmavě červených
vlnitých plechů. Vpředu jsou kromě dveří ještě dvě okna a další okno je na
levé straně. Na střeše stojí žlutá kachna. Střechou se prodírá bílý komín.
Na anténě na levé straně střechy je uvázaná šňůra na prádlo, na které visí
zelený top, světle modré kalhoty a bílé kalhotky, přichycené červenými kolíčky na prádlo.
Napravo od domu je veranda se solárním panelem. Pod verandou je matrace, červený sud od
oleje a šedý kufr.
Za domem jsou hromady starých věcí, na kterých můžeme rozeznat pračku, auto,
a mnoho dřevěných prken.

je Zangemann a jeho vila.
]]
Daleko odtud, na opačném konci města, žil slavný vynálezce Zangemann. Byl nesmírně bohatý. Žádný list papíru na světě nebyl dost velký na to, aby se na něj vešel zůstatek jeho účtu se všemi těmi číslicemi a nulami. Bydlel v obrovském domě s bazénem a tobogánem, mnoha schodišti, věžemi, stovkami oken a tolika pokoji, že i on sám se v nich pravidelně ztrácel. Zangemannovo sídlo se nacházelo vysoko na kopci. Celé město měl pod sebou jako na dlani.

## 6 ##
==== Slide 3
Už v dětském věku Zangemanna fascinovaly počítače. Tehdy to ještě byly obrovské stroje s mnoha kabely a hlučnými ventilátory. Ve škole malý Zangemann často snil o tom, co by všechno s počítači dělal, kdyby byly jen o něco menší – dost malé na to, aby je mohl zabudovat do nejrůznějších zařízení. Jako první by zabudoval počítač do svého skateboardu, který by tak při jízdě vydával super zvuky, třeba jako siréna hasičů nebo start rakety. A vymyslel by stroj na zmrzlinu! Počítač by dokázal namíchat
ty nejlepší příchutě a zmrzlinu by zároveň i prodával. Jeho stroje by stály na každém rohu a on by si tak mohl skočit pro svou oblíbenou zmrzlinu, kdykoli by měl chuť. Kromě toho by postavil robota na úklid a stroj na třídění stavebnic, aby měl ve svém pokoji vždy krásně uklizeno. Zangemann měl každý den nové nápady. Nemohl myslet na nic jiného.

A skutečně. Čím více Zangemann rostl, tím více se počítače zmenšovaly. Když nakonec opustil školu, byly už tak malé, že se mu vešly do kapsy u kalhot. A ty nejmenší se vešly jen na špičku prstu.

** 7 **

[[I:ada-p07
OBRÁZEK: Zangemann jako dítě sedící na židli u školního stolu. Z jeho hlavy vychází šest bublin, ve kterých jsou jeho nápady, kam vložit počítače: systém pro videohovory, reproduktor, pračka, skateboard s rádiovým ovládáním, náramkový počítač a počítač na rameni s monitorem a klávesnicí. Zangemann má šedé vlasy, nosí brýle a má tmavě fialové tričko s modrými vodorovnými pruhy, modré šortky, hnědé boty a bílé ponožky. Na levém zápěstí má velké moderní hodinky. Na stole je otevřený sešit, žlutá tužka a guma, zatímco na straně stolu visí jeho hnědá aktovka.
]]

## 8 ##
==== Slide 4
„Konečně můžu všechny své nápady uskutečnit!“ jásal Zangemann a pustil se do práce. Zabudoval malé počítače do nejrůznějších zařízení a udělal je ještě praktičtější. A tyto přístroje pak prodával.

[[I:ada-p08b
OBRÁZEK: Zangemannova originální zmrzlinovačka.
Je světle modrá, podobná automatu na nápoje, ale místo kelímku je zde kornoutek, který se plní zmrzlinou. Nad dávkovačem je monitor, který zobrazuje druh zmrzliny, který se právě podává. V tomto případě je to ananasová zmrzlina.
Vlevo se nachází otvor pro vkládání mincí, různé tlačítka pro výběr příchutě a otvor pro vracení mincí.
Nahoře je kulatý bílý znak s kopečkem cukrově růžové zmrzliny v kornoutku.
Na zadní straně stroje je chladicí zařízení s písmenem „Z“ jako logem Zangemanna.
]]
Dospělí i děti jeho vynálezy milovali. Děti chtěly mít Zangemannův skateboard a a k němu pokaždé ten nejnovější zvuk, aby se s ním mohly chlubit kamarádům na školním dvoře. Mnozí měli také jeho praktické reproduktory. Stačilo do nich jen uvést název písně a ta se hned začala přehrávat. Komu ještě nějaké kapesné zbylo, mohl si odpoledne koupit automaticky namíchanou zmrzlinu z originální Zangemannovy zmrzlinovačky. Vypadalo to jako kouzla, ale vše zařizovaly malé počítače, které Zangemann do svých přístrojů vestavěl.
[[I:ada-p08a
OBRÁZEK: Originální Zangemannův elektrický skateboard zanechávající modrou stopu s notami a barevnými kruhy. Z dítěte, které jede na skateboardu, jsou vidět jenom kolena, bílé ponožky a olivově zelené boty s bílou podrážkou.

[[I:ada-p09
OBRÁZEK: Ada kutí s předměty ve své improvizované laboratoři.
Ada sedí na převrácené přepravce na lahve a pracuje na opravě s pomocí žlutého šroubováku. Na stole jsou také zelené kleště, červené kladivo, bílá prodlužovací šňůra a další přístroj. Ada pracuje u stolu, který se skládá z dřevěné desky položené na dvou olejových sudech (jednom šedém a jednom červeném) a malém dřevěném kozlíku. Za Adou je pračka, potrubí a deska. Před improvizovaným stolem jsou pneumatiky a starý telefon s vadným drátem. Alan přichází k Adě a nad hlavou drží žlutý větrák. Alan má nyní na sobě bílé ponožky a žluté boty.
]]
Také u Ady ve škole byly tyto vynálezy velmi oblíbené a mnoho jejích kamarádů jezdilo na těch parádních skateboardech sem a tam. Ada však byla často smutná, protože její maminka jí žádnou z těch skvělých věcí nemohla koupit: ani skateboard, ani reproduktory, ba ani žádnou zmrzlinu.
==== Slide 5
Naštěstí bydlela přímo vedle vrakoviště. Tam se nacházely rozbité přístroje a rezavé součástky, ze kterých si stavěla úžasné věci: krabice od mýdla, ve které sjížděla s bratříčkem Alanem z kopců, větrnou turbínu nebo děsivá monstra ze šrotu, nad kterými pak společně vítězili. Našla tam i mnoho užitečných věcí, například jeden starý mobil. Displej byl sice trochu naprasklý, ale ten by si koneckonců mohla opravit. A přestože na vrakovišti nebyl internet, mohla by se k němu připojit někde jinde.

Stavění a opravování rozbitých věcí na vrakovišti Adu tak pohltilo, že na skateboardy a zmrzlinu nakonec úplně zapomněla.

## 10 ##
==== Slide 6
Because everyone bought his inventions, Zangemann soon became the
richest person in the whole world. With all his money, he bought a huge
golden computer with a keyboard made of jewels and set it up in the
largest room of his mansion. From there, over the internet, he could
control all the little computers built into his inventions.

All he had to do was press the proper key on the golden computer, and
immediately all the ice-cream machines in town would dispense only
vanilla ice cream. If Zangemann wanted people to eat chocolate ice
cream, he pressed the key for chocolate ice cream. If he gave the order
for lemon ice cream, the machines made only lemon ice cream. Zangemann
loved his inventions and was always thrilled at how amazingly well his
machines worked. Sometimes people were disappointed when their favorite
flavor wasn’t available, but what could they do? After all, there was
ice cream on every street corner.
[[I:ada-p10
IMAGE: A white power strip attached to a wall socket. The power strip
has 3 sockets and a green switch. One of the sockets is attached to a
plug with a gray cable.
]]

** 11 **

Zangemann had a lot of fun pressing the sparkling keys and
watching people eat ice cream. He spent many hours every
day in front of his golden computer doing this. Again
and again, he looked down on the city through a
long telescope, observing how reliably his
inventions carried out his commands.
[[I:ada-p11
IMAGE: Zangeman sitting in front of his golden computer on a golden
armchair with a very tall red padded backrest at whose top is the “Z” of
the Zangemann logo. He is wearing a purple turtle-neck sweater and light
blue trousers.
The computer has four ornate monitors of various sizes, each of which
has the logo on the back. It is integrated into a costly wooden desk
from which a gray cable flows that is connected to the power strip of
the previous page.
]]

## 12 ##
==== Slide 7
When he wasn’t sitting at his golden computer, Zangemann was building
his little computers into new devices and then selling those. He built
washing machines that sent a message to your cell phone when your
laundry was done. He made vacuums that played happy music instead of
droning loudly. He invented light bulbs that turned on and off at the
snap of a finger and cars that told you where the nearest grocery store
was.
[[I:ada-p12
IMAGE: City landscape with houses and shops, with a central street
turning right. On the road there are a car and a cyclist.
There are various children and adults walking or going on skateboards,
some eating ice cream, while others are buying ice cream from the
original Zangemann machines.
]]
Soon, almost every appliance in the world had a Zangemann computer built
into it. Not all of his inventions seemed necessary at first, but people
bought everything he made. That’s just the way it was. Everyone wanted
the devices made by Zangemann, the greatest inventor in the world.

** 13 **

One day Zangemann thought, “Today I want to see my inventions up close.”
He put away his big telescope, then climbed down the many stairs of
his mansion and ventured out into the city, full of anticipation at
the thought of enjoying his cool devices.
[[I:ada-p13
IMAGE: Zangemann descends the stairs from his mansion on the hill
towards the city.
Zangemann's house stands on a hill. The front is blue with large
windows; the towers are dark blue, and from a window starts a yellow
slide that ends in a large swimming pool with two palm trees. The roofs
are red, and above the highest tower an antenna is installed.
On the sides of the stairs to get off the hill there are evergreen
trees.
]]

## 14 ##

“Maybe a little trip might even give me a few new ideas. If I’m
completely honest, my last inventions weren’t quite as useful as the
first ones... ,” Zangemann pondered. “But my ice-cream machines are and
will remain second to none,” he thought immediately afterward, and not
without pride, as he passed a group of people all eating coconut ice
cream, the flavor of the day.
==== Slide 8
He was completely absorbed in his thoughts when suddenly — BAM! —
something crashed into his shin.
[[I:ada-p14
IMAGE: Zangemann after the incident with the child. Zangemann screams
from pain while holding up one of his legs with both hands at the shin.
The child has brown hair that is blown back by Zangemann's scream; he is
wearing a light blue hooded sweatshirt and dark green pants. He holds a
red Zangemann electric skateboard.
]]

** 15 **

Zangemann yelped and looked around for the cause. A startled child stood
in front of him, holding an original Zangemann skateboard under his arm.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to do that,” the child stammered, but Zangemann
wasn’t listening.

An angry Zangemann limped away. Suddenly, he heard loud music. He had
never before heard something so horrible. He looked around and saw that
the music was coming from a loudspeaker he himself had constructed. A
child across the street was holding it. The child seemed to like the
music, but it gave Zangemann a terrible headache, and his mood worsened.
This was not how he had imagined his walk!
[[I:ada-p15

light green t-shirt and a pea green sweater, dark brown pants, and light
green heeled shoes. She has a fuchsia shoulder bag, worn behind her.
She pushes a small shopping cart in which there is a small brown dog
with a collar and tag.
]]

## 16 ##
==== Slide 9
Zangemann was so furious with the two children. How dare they use his
inventions this way? That night, he couldn’t sleep, so he sat down at
his golden computer. From there, he gave all the little computers in the
skateboards a command that they were no longer allowed to go on
sidewalks. He ordered the small computers in the speakers to play music
only at a low volume, except for his favorite music, which he
immediately turned on to get into a better mood.
[[I:ada-p16

from Zangemann.

## 18 ##
==== Slide 10
[T]he next day, there was a big commotion at Ada’s school. On the way to
school, the kids’ skateboards had stopped working. The wheels simply
stood still. And the children could no longer turn up the volume on
their speakers. What was going on?
[[I:ada-p18
IMAGE: Five kids from the school who can't make skateboards work. Two
girls wear helmets, respectively blue and red. A little girl with brown
hair tied in two tails with yellow rubber bands is kneeling. She is
trying to understand why the skateboard of her friend with the red
helmet does not work. Four children have backpacks on their shoulders,
while the little girl with the red helmet left hers leaning on a bench
on which there are a yellow apple and a light blue bottle with a white
flower on it.
]]

** 19 **

Although she didn’t own any of these things, Ada wondered why the
skateboards and the speakers suddenly stopped working. But she didn’t
really have time to think much about it, because she was tinkering
again. She put together a complete bicycle from the parts of three
broken bicycles. She gave the bicycle to her mother as a present so
that she wouldn’t have to spend her money on bus tickets to work. For
her brother, Ada built a loudspeaker so he could fall asleep to nice
stories in the evenings when their mother was still at work.

[[I:ada-p19
IMAGE: Close-up of Ada thoughtful, with a backpack and with one hand on
her chin and the other resting on her side.
]]
After a few days, the initial shock at Ada’s
school was forgotten. The skateboards
still didn’t go on the sidewalk, but
apart from that, they still worked.
And so now the children rode in
circles around the playground and
listened to soft music. Only a strange,
pompous marching music continued
to play at an unchanged volume, which
the children found rather puzzling.

## 20 ##
==== Slide 11
[A]da loved Wednesdays. Every Wednesday, her mother and Alan would
pick her up from school, and they would all go to the library together.
Ada was always drawn to the technology section. There were books with
blueprints, instructions for experiments, and explanations of how
different devices worked. In the library, Ada could also go online with
her cell phone. She quickly realized that there was also much to
discover on the internet. There, many people shared their ideas and
repair tips to help others.

On one of those afternoons, Ada learned two new words: hardware and
software. Hardware was a word for something Ada already knew: the
electronic devices she tinkered with after school, or those devices she
could hold in her hands and try to fix or make into something else. What
was completely new to Ada was the word software. She soon learned that
it meant instructions that ran on a computer to control other devices or
computers. Some books called those instructions programs or code. With
such a computer program, one could, for example, tell a loudspeaker
which song to play and how loud.

The best thing about Ada’s new discovery was realizing that she could
tinker with software just as she could with hardware. Hardware is built
with tools — hammers, drills, and screws. Software is built simply by
writing down the commands for the hardware, one after the other. There
was a separate language for this — the programming language. With
software, Ada could make her inventions even more useful. She really
wanted to learn the programming language!

** 21 **

[[I:ada-p21
IMAGE: Computer screen from which the elements of the programming
language symbolically emerge: “while num > 0“, “init“, “sx=42“, “for“,

Ada is typing on a white keyboard with a blue cable, while her other
hand enters the screen to change the program (“print(msg)”, “a+b+c+d=e”,
“if”, “break”, “continue”, “exit()“). Next to the keyboard there are a
pencil and an eraser.
]]

## 22 ##
==== Slide 12
[O]ver the next few weeks, Ada spent her afternoons in the library.
She found books and websites that explained how programming
languages and code worked. For Ada, it felt a bit like learning a secret
language, or like studying vocabulary in school. Ada ate it all up. She
expected her first program to do something simple: “Make this lamp
blink!”

Of course, she wanted to try her program out right away to see if it
really worked. At the junkyard, she connected her cell phone to a small
LED lamp. Then she typed the lines of code into her cell phone.

At first, nothing happened. Ada wondered where the error could be. She
made a few small changes and tried again and .... “Yeesss!” The little
light began to flash. On, off, on, off. Ada looked at the LED in
amazement. She had written her first program!

Ada was totally thrilled. She imagined all the great things she could
do. If she just entered the right code, she could make her inventions do
exactly what she wanted. It was not so easy, but after a few weeks, Ada
wrote a truly useful program: one that would make Alan’s speakers
automatically turn off half an hour after he had fallen asleep.

Ada also had an idea for the next program she would write. It was a
bigger deal, a real project. She would probably need the whole summer
break for it... And she could hardly wait!

==== Slide 13
[Z]angemann had slept horribly every night since his terrible walk in the
city. When he went to bed each night, worries plagued him. “Oh no, my
marvelous inventions. It can’t be that everyone just plays around with
them. All the things that could go wrong! I put so much thought into
everything, down to the last detail.” Zangemann pondered and pondered
and tossed and turned sleeplessly in his bed all night.

Waking up one morning with a deeply furrowed brow, he made a decision.
He needed to make a change. Zangemann sat down at his computer and wrote
one program after another. In these programs, he specified exactly what
his inventions were to do and were not to do under any circumstances.
The chaos had to stop!

Once he was done, he sent all the new programs from his golden computer
to people’s devices. He ordered his speakers to play only his favorite
music whenever he was within earshot. He programmed the ice-cream
machines to stop selling ice cream in the afternoon. After all, he
didn’t want his expensive clothes to get stained by ice cream while he
was out for a walk. All day long he sat at the computer and typed and
typed and typed...

## 26 ##
==== Slide 14
[S]ummer break was already halfway over. Ada stood in front of her big
project and scratched her head. She had built a skateboard from old parts
and then connected a motor to make the wheels turn. With a motorized
skateboard, Ada could zoom to the library or the junkyard even faster
after school. Super practical! But it didn’t work. When she stood on it
and pressed the Go! button, the wheels moved, but way too fast. Ada fell
off the skateboard every time she started. No matter what she tried, she
just couldn’t get it right.

After falling on her bottom for the hundredth time, she went back to the
library. She always found answers to her questions there. And indeed,
on the internet, she came across a program that someone had written for
an electric scooter that also needed to start slowly. Ada downloaded it
to her phone.

Back at the junkyard, she adapted some lines of code for her skateboard
program. She tweaked a few things and kept tinkering.

Several failed attempts later, on the last day of summer break, the time
had finally come. Ada stood on the skateboard and pressed the Go!
button, and the skateboard started moving, slowly at first, then faster.
It worked! She tried to brake. It worked! Ada let out a cry of joy and
took a trip to the park.

the electronic part is below). Ada is holding in both hands a remote
control with a short antenna to maneuver it.
Behind Ada are Marie and Toni who carry their own skateboards under
their arms and look with amazement at Ada, who has shot past them and in
front of them.
Marie has dark long hair with two braids fastened with orange clips,
yellow earrings, a fuchsia shirt with white sleeves with purple
horizontal stripes, a white skirt, white and yellow sneakers, white
socks, a white hat with yellow sides, and a light purple backpack. Marie
has a blue artificial leg. Her skateboard is blue with yellow wheels.
Toni has red hair closely trimmed on the sides. He is wearing a blue
sweatshirt, dark green pants, and white shoes. He has a red backpack
with white inserts and shoulder straps. One hand is next to his mouth.
His skateboard is purple with orange wheels.
There's also a father with his son walking in the opposite direction:
the father is dressed in a blue checked jacket and blue pants and holds
a brown briefcase. He is smiling at Ada.
His son has a blue shirt, blue shorts, white shoes, a brown backpack,
and a red and white hat. He holds under his arm a yellow Zangemann
skateboard with light brown wheels, and he grins at Ada.
In the background there is a bakery with large windows through which you

==== Slide 15
When Ada rode her skateboard to school on the first day back after
summer break, the other children were amazed. During recess, Ada’s
curious classmates surrounded her.

“How can you ride your skateboard on the sidewalk?” they asked.
[[I:ada-p28

one end. She is pointing to Ada's skateboard and she's talking.
Next to her is Konrad, with short blond hair, a dark gray helmet,

with white cuffs, and gray shoes with white soles. He has a red
skateboard with orange wheels.
Behind Ada there are 4 other children. On the other end Toni is smiling.
He touches his chin with one hand while with the other he holds a yellow
helmet by the laces.
]]

** 29 **

Ada thought for a moment, then said, “I don’t think it’s your
skateboards but actually the software in them. It’s probably programmed
into the software that the skateboards aren’t allowed to go on the
sidewalk. But that can be changed!”

That evening, Ada tested out her theory on her classmate Toni’s
skateboard. She worked secretly through most of the night, and the next
day, Toni could ride on the sidewalk again. Unfortunately, his
skateboard could no longer make the sounds that his parents had bought
from Zangemann. Instead, every 10 minutes it made a strange noise that
sounded like a drawn-out burp. Ada knew that little errors like that
could pop up in programs all the time. But Toni’s burping skateboard was
really quite funny.

## 30 ##
==== Slide 16
[M]ore and more children started to visit Ada at the junkyard after school,
and she helped them rewrite the programs in their skateboards.
Some of her classmates were very excited about this new discovery. It
was unbelievable what you could do with software code! They wanted to
learn everything Ada knew about programming languages, and soon they
were riding their skateboards again, wherever they wanted to.
==== Slide 17
But that wasn’t all. With the software, they could give their
skateboards new, cool features. Marie attached colorful LED lights to
her board that glowed different colors depending on the speed. Konrad
built old propellers onto his skateboard for extra speed.

** 31 **

Ada, Toni, Marie, and Konrad spent many afternoons at the junkyard. They
even set up a real workshop where they could fine-tune their programs
for hours, listening all the while to music from the speakers Ada had
built for Alan.

“Your brother’s speakers are much louder than ours,” remarked Toni, who
was busy attaching a speedometer to his helmet.
“I’m sure that’s also because of the software,” Marie said.

Together, they changed the software for the speakers too. Then they
turned up the music as loud as possible and danced wildly together.

]]

** 35 **
==== Slide 18
[E]very day, Ada and her friends made plans together for the afternoon.
From a broken ice-cream machine, they built a new one that could make
ice cream in every imaginable shape and color. They ate square ice
cream, heart-shaped ice cream, and even pyramid-shaped ice cream, as
well as strawberry, raspberry, and rainbow ice cream, all with sprinkles
and hot fudge — much better than the varieties from the Zangemann
machines.

Sometimes they could even help adults. Toni reprogrammed his father’s
ironing machine so that it could also iron ties again — Zangemann had
forbidden the machines to do so because he hated ties like the plague.
For the bus driver, they built an automatic watering system out of old
hoses and a computer so that her plants would not die of thirst during
summer days. And they helped the school custodian modify his vacuum so
that it automatically recognized toys and wouldn’t suck them up.

Some things they built just for fun, like the fart machine they put in
their math teacher’s chair. Whenever Ms. Gernet sat down, the machine
played a little fart sound. The teacher would scold them, but Ada was
sure that she secretly smirked a little every time.

## 36 ##
==== Slide 19
[O]ne day, Zangemann noticed that some computers no longer obeyed
his programming commands. Shocked and fuming with anger, he
called the president. In a quivering voice, Zangemann yelled, “Someone
is rewriting the programs in my devices. That can’t happen; after all,
they are my inventions. It’s far too dangerous if everyone can do
whatever they want with the computers. You must make a law against
this!”

The president did not want to upset Zangemann. All the government’s
computers were programmed by Zangemann. Without the computers, the
government would not be able to run the country. So they passed the law
as Zangemann
requested:

“All computers that do not listen to Zangemann are banned. Anyone who
reprograms Zangemann’s devices will be fined 500,000 gold pieces!”

and a blue jacket with yellow buttons.
The President is sitting on a green chair with white vertical lines, and
his other hand is on the desk. On the desk, in addition to the
videophone, there are sheets with something written on them and an open
purple fountain pen.

two olives on a toothpick, over a blue napkin with white stripes.

## 38 ##
==== Slide 20
When Ada and her friends heard this, they were furious. “This is
unfair,” they
said. “We rebuilt and reprogrammed our skateboards ourselves. They are
much
better now. We won’t let anyone take that away from us!”

They gathered in front of one of their rebuilt ice-cream machines and
discussed
the situation. It was clear that something had to be done about the new
law, and
they made a plan...

==== Slide 21
[T]he next day, they didn’t go to school. Instead, they rode their
skateboards to the parliament building, with large protest signs
under their arms, and sat down in front of the building. The evening
before, they had put LED lights on some of the signs, which were now
flashing brightly. They had connected their speakers together so
everyone in the street could hear what they were saying. Some passersby
stopped and asked the children what they were demonstrating for.
“For software freedom!” they replied in unison and told the adults their
story. Impressed, the adults nodded, and the president also looked
curiously at their signs as he approached the building.

On the following day, Ada and her friends again sat down in front of the
parliament building, this time with support. Some classmates came whose
skateboards Ada had reprogrammed. Toni’s father and other parents and
adults also wanted to support the protest. They found the children’s
devices very useful.

## 40 ##

With each passing day, more and more children and adults joined the
protest. The bus driver they had helped drove up in her bus. She honked
loudly to attract even more people to the protest. The custodian brought
a few friends, and Toni’s father brought his colleagues from work, all
wearing perfectly ironed ties. Even Ms. Gernet came. The crowd grew, and
after a few weeks, there were protests not just in Ada’s city but also
in many cities throughout the country.
[[I:ada-p40-41

[A]da protested in front of the parliament building every week, even in
pouring rain. On one such rainy day, when the president passed the group
of dripping-wet children, he couldn’t help but admire their
stubbornness. He asked Ada, “Why do you sit here every day? What do you
want to achieve?” Ada replied, “We want to determine for ourselves what
we can and cannot do with our computers.” Her friends shouted in unison:
“Don’t wreck our tech! Don’t wreck our tech!” and “We want the code! We
want the code!”

The president looked at the determined faces of the children. Honestly,
he, too, wanted to decide for himself what the government could and
couldn’t do with its computers. But he didn’t understand anything about
computers and code, so he had always left that to Zangemann. Deep in
thought, the president entered the building.
==== Slide 22
[[I:ada-p42

air is typing on a laptop. He has wavy brown hair parted in the center,

computer there are a green cup and two open books.
]]
The next day, the president invited Ada and her friends over. “We also
want to be in charge of our software ourselves. In order for that to be
true, the government must be independent from Zangemann. Can you tell me
what you know about computer programs?” he asked them. Enthusiastically,
they explained to him how software works and what you could do with it.
The president was amazed.

** 43 **

With this new knowledge, the government would be able to design its own
software, the way it wanted — completely without Zangemann. Immediately,
the president called his advisers. In a large group, they discussed with
the children everything they could change and improve in the software.

That evening, the children went home proud and satisfied. Something
finally happened! Their long protest was worth it.

## 44 ##

[T]he next morning, the president’s phone rang very early. It was
Zangemann. He was angrier than ever. “Without me, the government
computers will no longer work,” he threatened. But the president kept
the call short and quickly hung up. The phone rang many more times that
day, but Zangemann’s calls went unanswered. The president sat in a
meeting with Ada, Toni, Marie, Konrad, and the government experts.

[[I:ada-p44
IMAGE: A herald, wearing a hat with a plume, playing a trumpet on which
a red banner is hung.
]]
In the days that followed, they talked from morning to night and designed their
first programs for the government’s computers. They were no longer disturbed
by Zangemann’s calls. Toni had the good idea of reprogramming
the telephones. When Zangemann called, he
only heard an automated recording: “The
government only wants to use software
that it can freely use, study, share, and
improve. Thank you for calling.”
==== Slide 23
Then, after many weeks of protests and
discussions, the time had finally come:
they abolished the old Zangemann law!
Instead, the government announced:

** 45 **

“Everyone is allowed to program their own computers as long as they
adhere to the other laws.”

In addition, a new school subject was introduced: computer hardware and
software.

==== Slide 24
That evening, everyone celebrated with a big party. Ada, Alan, Toni,
Marie, Konrad, and other children from school and their parents; the
president; Ms. Gernet; the bus driver; the custodian — they were all
there. They decorated the streets, listened to loud music, and ate ice
cream, as much as they wanted, and in every imaginable shape and color.

for new inventions. And they wanted to start right away.

[A]nd Zangemann? No one’s heard much from him. Maybe he’s still sitting
angrily in front of his golden computer. Maybe he doesn’t dare go out
into the street anymore and has boarded up all the windows of his
mansion so that he doesn’t have to worry about what other people are
doing with his inventions. But maybe he also sometimes looks out into
the world through his telescope and sees what the children are inventing
every day. Perhaps then he will remember how much fun it was for himself
to tinker and experiment. And maybe, just maybe, he eats pyramid-shaped
raspberry ice cream with rainbow sprinkles.

[T]he inventor Zangemann is world-famous and immensely rich. Adults and
children alike love his fabulous technical inventions. But one day there
is a problem: the children's electronic skateboards no longer work
properly. What’s going on? The curious girl Ada sees through what is
going on. Together with her friends, she experiments with hardware and
software, and the children forge a plan: Zangemann can no longer be the
only one in control of the devices!

A book that arouses interest in tinkering and encourages shaping
technology.
